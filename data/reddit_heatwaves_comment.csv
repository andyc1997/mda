In Belgium, sweltering right now, got curious and decided to google other heatwaves happening around the world. Spare a thought for Iraq, their current heatwave is pushing daily temps up to 48 degrees C. And that's with constant power cuts. They have to put tape on outside door handles.

"So many die during these events for the same reason that there are so many road accidents in Texas when it snows.

&#x200B,

Europe isn't prepared for events like these as they so seldom need AC during the summer that most places simply don't have it at all. You can tell from the article title how rarely this happens that the last time this happened was 2003. The average AC system needs replacing about once every 15 years, but in the US we get to use them for a solid 3-9 months a year depending on where you live and buildings without AC are exceedingly rare. So we get our money's worth, and we use them often. In Britain or France (who are in the same latitude as Nova Scotia and New Foundland), they would probably turn the AC on 4-5 times in its life cycle, and they don't have the infrastructure in place to maintain them as compared to Texas (which is in the same latitude as Egypt), where an AC repair technician can have work basically 10+ months out of the year. But if it snows in Texas, nobody has any snow tires or any prep for real winter weather, and so for those few days, we have to shut down the city, even if its a light dusting, and we will still have hundreds if not thousands of accidents in a day as people venture out anyways.

&#x200B,

Abnormalities in weather affect people the most because they aren't prepared for them, as they have no reason to be prepared for anything that isn't normal. Most americans don't realize how far North Europe is, even Spain and Portugal are only at the same rough latitude as Pennsylvania, but benefit climatically by being surrounded by the ocean/sea in that their winters are milder than Pennsylvania.";0.0;es1nlns;t3_c5e7zr;2019-06-26 08:17:56;7591.0

I live in Midwest US and the heat index is currently 86F (30C), 91F (32C) with heat index (it personally feels much hotter than that to me - absolutely no cloud cover.) We spent all of last summer (hitting upwards of 43C without heat index, 48C with) with absolutely no A/C system.

&#x200B,

Here's some tips to help stay cool and healthy:

Open your windows. If you can get a fan, *point the fans out of the house and out the windows.* **This might be dependent on your location and the way your home is built:**

edit: /u/whtml mentioned: "" Anything slightly north in Europe usually has great insulation, so opening the windows during the day is the biggest mistake people usually make because you won't easily get the heat back out. I close everything during the day including the outside blinds (\~80% reduction in energy hitting your window) and can manage a difference to the outside of 6C easily. Only let actual cool air in during the night. ""

&#x200B,

also edit: white sheets and blinds in your windows! The white reflects light and heat, while darker shades like black absorb it.

Keep well-stocked on ice. You can put ice on a platter and blow a fan over it (assuming you can get one), sit in front of the fan, and find joy in having poor-man's A/C. Even a simple desk or hand fan would work for this. Take turns with your family.

Drink water! Preferably room temperature. Gross, I know, but cold water when you're hot can cause damage to your body!

Drink Pedialyte or your country's equivalent. Seriously. Fuck Gatorade, fuck Powerade, *go for Pedialyte.* It will help keep you more hydrated and give you some of your energy back.

Wet a bunch of washrags or hand towels, wring them out, and stick them in the freezer. For a quick cool-down (just make sure you're not too hot first!!) you can take these out and place them on top of your head or on the back of your neck. Stick back in the freezer when done.

*Don't use your ovens!* Try to cook everything in the microwave or on the stovetop if possible until the heat wave passes.

If it's hotter inside than it is outside, *stay outside in the shade.* It sucks, I know, but it's better than suffocating to death.

*Do not give your pets ice cubes.* Room temperature water will suffice.

Do everything you can to not exert too much energy and stay as hydrated as possible without overdoing it. Water and Pedialyte is massively important! I also recommend Popsicles 'cuz sometimes they give that refreshing feel you need.

*Stay away from dairy.* You're gonna feel nauseous sometimes from the heat and dairy is just going to add to that. Eating dairy and then getting too hot can cause you to get extremely ill.

"It's too bad [France fumbled their carbon tax](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46522126).

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses, because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) in the first place. We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support.

"I live in the north of Spain and is not that bad (in the south is stronger but again we are used to it). It’s hot, but we are used to hot. Between 25º and 34 or 38º Celsius is an average summer here. I am lucky enough to live in an area where at night the temperature goes down most days so it’s fairly easy to sleep and during the day sometimes there is a slightly nice breeze that helps a lot. But in general, we just stay inside during the worst hours, we have a couple of fans at home for when its really hot and we don’t go outside between 1.30 and 4.00 pm. That’s why lots of the stores close during those hours, because those are the strongest moments of the sun and the unhealthiest hours to be working or just plain doing any activity outside, avoid those hours out and you’ll be fine. Also use sunscreen all the time, no matter how much sun there is or if there are clouds. Use it or you will regret it in the future. That and drink lots of water. 

Also the best way to cope with heat, aside from being inside as much as possible, is to use comfortable not tight but  baggy clothes that cover at least your back and shoulders. Contrary to what most people do, taking everything out is the worst thing you can do in extreme heat, you will still feel hot and you will burn yourself. And that hurts like a bitch. Don’t do it. Also use caps, kerchiefs and sunglasses as much as possible. There is a reason why in the dessert they are very dressed not naked. Having light but long clothes actually helps a lot.

"As someone who has spent 10 kentucky summers with no ac.... (when we had our kid we used it) my advice to the coming heat wave is 

Close all windows and shades to make the area dark and let no light in

At night open windows and install box fans blowing *out* the windows. I know this sounds counterintuitive,  but it will suck out the hot air and cause a breeze. 

Use ceiling fans

Remember warm air rises, we moved our room downstairs during the summer and upstairs during the winter

Cold showers are amazing and dont completly dry off. It is amazing to feel the breeze cool you

Humidity sucks. Make sure to have plenty of water and Gatorade or something like it.  During the 100f spell here with 70 to 80% humidity. I would down some Gatorade and then water. Alternating each. 

Dont forget animals!!!! I buy powdered Gatorade and will mix it with their water. I found my horses LOVE blue Gatorade and thus I usually buy that.

"For anyone walking through these comments refusing to believe the death tolls etc...

Across most of northern and central Europe, our **houses are designed to RETAIN HEAT.**

**Air conditioning is NOT A THING.** (we have fans but they really only serve to push hot air around) Public drinking fountains are not a thing. 

We are also experiencing a loneliness epidemic - basically, we kinda ignore the elderly, so they don't have anyone looking out for them.

When we get a heatwave, the temperature usually goes from say about 20C and below (UK) to the early 30s with sudden high humidity. It's a shock to the system for most, let alone the poorly/old.

Next time you're walking about your air conned house or a shop, imagine what it would be like *without* it in a sudden and painful heatwave that is immense, relative to what you're used to.";0.0;es2ss7f;t3_c5e7zr;2019-06-26 18:42:33;4.0

"Tips on how to keep cool without AC: don't open your windows during the day. Air at night and in the morning while outside air is cooler. 

If the sun shines through your window get

1.    Shades if you can but not on the inside. If placed on the inside they just take the sun rays through the glass and turn into heat emitting radiators. 

2. One of those heat reflecting foils you can cut and place on the outside window.

3. If you can't get your hand on a foil, get a white sheet, drench it in water place it over the window on the outside and close the window. When the sheet dries, repeat. The heat that would othervise hit your window will be utilized to evaporate the water, reducing energy transfer trough the glass.


Cold showers. Cold buckets of water, chill feet. Cold cloths around neck. Ice packs wrapped in cloths, placed under feet. Cool bottles of water from fridge or freezer(don't fill bottle to the brim, water expands when it's freezing!)


 If you have an ordinary fan, moisten your neck, wrist area(or whole body) and turn on the fan. Evaporating water will cool you down.


6. Personally I avoid heavy foods during the warmest period of day. My body craves veggies,  salads, fruit, ice pops and water.

"> HUR DUR, WE COULD REALLY USE SOME OF THAT GLOBAL COOLING RIGHT ABOUT NOW! /s

It's almost like over the past two decades the swing in temperature has become more and more dramatic because of the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the depletion of the polar ice caps cooling the oceans and decreasing the salinity, and the constant onslaught of deforestation.

I live in Canada but my friend grew up in France, she said a main reason the heat wave is so devestating in France is because they don't have the means to deal with such weather, not as many places to swim in cities and That overall the people living there aren't acclimatized to the hot weather as it is abnormal. I find it sickening that so many people are turning this into a big dick contest about where they live being hotter. Live in Texas? If you went to northern Canada mid winter you would have trouble with cold just as much as they struggle with heat.

Pro tip, wet shirt and a fan.  I have no AC and when its gets to be 90+ in the house I glomp around the house in wet shirt and boxers.  Keep a second shirt in the fridge for extra chill and swap them out.  Remind yourself constantly to keep drinking water, stay ahead of dehydration.   Also if you have any elderly neighbors, pop by and see how they are doing, do they have a good fan to help keep cool?

1. Buy lots of gel ice packs. Have one for your neck, one for your back, and rotate them constantly, even at night. Your neck is the hottest part of your body because of the blood flow, so keep your neck cool.
2. At night, put towels down with several ice packs underneath. If you wake up, rotate the ice packs.
3. Cut your hair, or keep your hair up. Keep your neck exposed.
4. Drink a ton of water. You should be peeing once every hour and it should be completely clear. It helps you regulate your body temp.

4. I generally close windows during the day and open them at night.

"No technology, no policy, no regulation, will ever be sufficient to allow a socioeconomic belief system that demands perpetual consumption fueled growth such as capitalism,  to outrun the immutable physics of a finite world.

&#x200B,

We use 20 million years worth of fossil fuels every 12 months. We move 10 times the dirt across this earth than all natural processes combined. If we stopped emissions this very minute temperatures will still increase for near 4 decades and possibly far longer if natural feedback gain sufficient control. And due to capitalism doubling in size over roughly 30 year periods the rates of consumption never stop rising.

&#x200B,

The path we are on of trying to modify an anti democratic infinite growth economic system into compliance with democracy and what physics demands of humanity, is suicidal, no matter how many solar panels, Tesla cars and green new deals you throw at it. Physics demands a different economic system, this one will never be able to be modified sufficiently in the time physics dictates and until we change the system, any efforts will merely be an attempt to kick the can down the road as the rate of growth in consumption of energy and materials to sustain this systems demand for perpetual growth is vastly outstripping any efforts we are making to repair the damage being done.

Don't be tempted to blame over population in order to excuse this system we all legitimise with every purchase and hour worked. It is not the fault of the bottom 3.5 billion people who have little to nothing per person when just the top 26 people have more.

&#x200B,

Solutions:

There is only 1 viable solution today. Physics says so not me, not X politicians, physics. And It says our only viable solution is mitigation. Which means a massive change to the way we live our lives. There is no getting around that as we pissed away the time we had to change ourselves slowly to avoid such a scenario.  Power, transport, food. We sort those out and that is a massive part of the job done.

&#x200B,

On food:

We need an economic model, that will allow the re localisation of production for most of the means of life allowing us to shrink our economic footprints as nations. Your salad coming from 3,000 miles away and your underpants from 4,000 miles away has to end along with your flights to where ever you like when ever you like.  The new economic model already exists, it is called democracy at work.

You can find the policy explained here:

You can find an example of how it is used to make cities self sufficient in organic food production that does not harm top soil and creates a massive carbon removal system by growing that in cities, along with good fulfilling employment, here: [https://youtu.be/TZ0tovrhf5Y](https://youtu.be/TZ0tovrhf5Y)  [https://youtu.be/JIWsxo5nNgg](https://youtu.be/JIWsxo5nNgg)

Meat production has to be massively reduced and plant based diets encouraged and if need be, enforced by law such as regulating that meat only be sold on say Christmas and thanksgiving for an example.

There is technology coming that may allow us to print meat without the agriculture emissions but that is still some time off.

&#x200B,

Transport: Some 60% of air traffic has to end which when you look at how many planes are in the sky is obvious. This cannot continue if we are to have a future, never mind grow.

[https://www.flightradar24.com/51.3,43.14/2](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&stzid=UgzGTm2xGuRROtpOBX54AaABAg.8w5roKhWuMy8w7LA9yRpOD&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flightradar24.com%2F51.3%2C43.14%2F2&redir_token=uWuZ7NWL5qU5IRM56w3Jx3odo_l8MTU2MTU5NzYwN0AxNTYxNTExMjA3)

&#x200B,

This can be overcome for the most part with a plan for a global rail infrastructure. I can already get a train from London to Beijing. The problem is as it has been done on a country by country basis it costs $5,000 a ticket rather than having a global unified electrified transport system that is cheap to use.   Which is what we need and can be done if we choose to work together as nations with a mutual interest, as when you remove the water all humans stand on the same rock regardless of their nation.

&#x200B,

On a national basis, subsidising the likes of Tesla is not the solution. Subsidising mass electrified transit that can be used for cost price that again is produced locally via democratic production and ran for cost, not for profit, and owned by the citizens not the speculators, and where possible provided for free for citizens, is the solution.

&#x200B,

Power:

This one is simple enough to understand. For advanced nations to keep to their target of no emissions that would cause average warming above 2oC from 1750 baseline (which frankly has already happened in the arctic) then they need to tripple the size of their energy grids and have all electrical energy generated from renewable sources, within 20 years.   And that would be for a stagnant economy, not growth.

&#x200B,

So what is needed is a steady state, resource based, democratic economy. None of which capitalism can, nor will ever be able to provide.

&#x200B,

Carbon capture and storage: Our Co2 pile is now at 415ppm and rising at 5% a year on avg. It has not been this high in the entire life of humanity, over 3 million years.

&#x200B,

When you factor in all the other gasses we have added and their effect, it gives a current effective Co2 ppm of roughly 480ppm of Co2 which has not been seen for far longer and the last time it was the sea was over 100 feet higher. That comes later if nothing is done.

&#x200B,

We will never be able to come up with a technology that can suck carbon out of the air at the rates required for the costs needed in the time permitted by physics. The best technology known to science is called a bloody tree. If every adult on the earth was organised by their local authorities to plant 1 tree per month between the adult age of 20 and 60, we would have planted 2.1 trillion tree's in a single human adult lifetime which would bring our Co2 ppm down somewhat.

&#x200B,

But, we are running out of time to do this. Once global temperatures are past +2oC global average (which they already are in the arctic) we can plant 2 trillion tree's sure but combinations of heat, the pests spread by heat, and droughts, and floods, will kill many of them before they reach maturity.

&#x200B,

On population:

The world population is expected to peak at around 10 billion circa 2050. With the scrapping of various patents allowing for various automation and renewable energy technologies involved given freely to the world, economic incentives can be used to incentivise biological degrowth and automation can help us  cope with that degrowth. You alleviate poverty and give people a reason not to have children as opposed to a reason to have them, that being crushing poverty the likes of which only capitalism can provide to a 3rd world nation. We have many years of evidence that shows the more economically secure a family is the smaller the family unit tends to be.

&#x200B,

There is much work to be done. But it cannot be done with any hope of success under an infinite growth economic belief system that is fundamentally against the physics of a finite world.";0.0;es2115g;t3_c5e7zr;2019-06-26 11:04:16;4.0

"My thoughts to our European friends, stay safe!

As a US Southerner, who has had their AC fail during the middle of summer, some advice. I know first hand how bad the heat can be when you don't have AC.

1. Blackout curtains are a worth while investment. The sun can bake the interior of your home, so keeping the light out can keep things a bit cooler. If you can't invest in those, just keeping the curtains closed our hanging up blankets over your window can help. Sunlight generates a lot of heat.
2. Use your freezer. Foot ice baths, freezing wet rags to cool off or ice water all help comfort wise.
3. Freeze your sheets. This is something I haven't done, but I've heard helps. It won't keep you cool through the night, but it'll help you fall asleep. Put them in a plastic bag and pop them in the freezer 30 minutes before bed or so.
4. DIY AC. A fan and a bucket of ice, its not great but its better than nothing.
5. Wear cotton PJs, sleeping naked when its hot as tempting as it may be isn't great since you don't have clothes to mop up the sweat.
6. Cooling pillow [(like this one)](https://www.amazon.com/Chillow-604232777510-%C2%AE-Comfort-Device/dp/B0000V0E14/?creativeASIN=B0000V0E14&linkCode=w61&imprToken=D8I5mO4XZBF7qwIk9IKXLA&slotNum=0&ascsubtag=634cacf1ed39bc3da47722b05b7ced68e007dc68&pf_rd_i=ybh&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1DWTHQ96H1PYNPYHK11G&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_t=1501&ref=pd_ybh_6?pf_rd_p=280800601&tag=lifehackeramzn-20), can help a lot! Another thing I haven't tried but I have a friend who swears by them.
7. If you have ceiling fans, have them run counter clockwise.
8. Sleep downstairs if you have a multistory place, heat rises.
9. Don't use your oven, grill outside instead.

"My mother grew up without AC in south Florida, US and here's some general tips on how to stay cool and safe.

1. Stay Hydrated - This seems basic but most people often forget to be consistently drinking water.
Drink no less than 9 cups or water a day. Increase the amount based on your thirst. 

2. Put a cold damp cloth on the back of your neck when you're feeling overheated.

3. There's a point where opening the windows and door to let air wont help reduce the temperature inside your home. So only open the windows and door to let the cool air in late at night and preferably morning.  This all depends on what your current temperature inside is.

4. Put yourself in front of fan and mist your face with cold water if you feel like you're becoming over heated. This is in addition to tip 2.

5. Put a cold damp cloth on your forehead when going to sleep. It's often times hard to sleep when you're hot and this'll help make you more comfortable in order to sleep.";0.0;es1yzhz;t3_c5e7zr;2019-06-26 10:38:51;1.0

Edit: 
Before everyone starts up with “but you have air conditioning!!!!!”- there are plenty of construction workers, linemen, landscapers, etc that work outside all day without air conditioning. It’s really just comes down to chugging as much water as you can. Its kind of funny because you notice after awhile that no matter how much water you chug, you never have to pee because you sweat it all out!

Also- as thankful as we are that you Europeans thought to put carbonation in otherwise boring ass water, (and we really are grateful, that shit is delicious) I would advise against that being your main source of hydration.

"So, instead of hypothetical, other places around the globe already experienced close to the expected temperatures of this incoming heatwave. This past April, Vietnam experienced record heat at 43.4 °C (110.1 °F). And this is a high humidity country where most homes do not have AC. A good percentage don't even have a proper roof  (i.e. many families literally live under a roof made out of leaves or, worse, scrap metal). It was so bad people piled into malls and just stay there to cool off. One report stated temps reached 60 degrees C in a car with window rolled up. 😱

"Don't you see that ACs are one of the reasons that it's getting hotter and hotter? I am not only talking about global warming, it's just a matter of people's mental state, or people's perception.
People were always living in really hot areas.
Yes, sometimes you suffer but isn't that just life?  
If not everybody would be used to ACs, nobody would ever need it. Its kind of the same deal with people being hypersensitive these days.

Some couple of years ago some douche decided that it's unbearable to sweat, or more specifically: let the body's inbuilt AC do the work, so he invented ACs.
I know that air humidity can minimise the effects of sweating but people always found (let's say non-electric) solutions for this, e.g. shading. 

Some other douche thought it would be a good idea to chill drinks electrically. 
Smart move, now that you're used to it, you don't  want to give up on it anymore.
//Well you actually can't because billions are depending on it - but that's a different story.

There are plenty of examples - people trying to find a solution, but by doing so they're stockpiling masses of waste, use fossile fuels, waste energy etc. 

Why do people always come up with selfish ideas, that are merely helping? 

When will this fast world slow down and relax? 

When will people get their days off at work because of heat? If you don't work you don't have to consume that much. (yes I'm living the dream , kappa) 
I know that crops got to be harvested or taken care off, and I know that Reddit servers depend on a solid workforce.
But why do we have to grow and grow?

It's really all our government's fault and that's from every nation. Tesla was trying to make hovercraft and he was pretty well on to it. Free electricity. But no. Free electricity would take money out of too many people's pockets. How would we arm nuclear waste and what about all the jobs of the people who wouldn't need to put up power lines anymore. I answered all of that is they could have been in school pushing science as a nation. We need to be pushing science on the youth and hopes that the Young Minds will come up with the Innovative technology that we need to better our planet. Presently it's like nobody really gives a f*** because none of the government's are really doing anything at least not American government. It's like how Polaroid had the digital camera before anybody else but didn't release it before everybody else caught on and came out with digital cameras before Polaroid because they didn't want to lose money on digital cameras from their Polaroid film. Everything is about money and our ecosystem and the temperature is being f***** by money-hungry bastards. In America people who run for president they get backing they get funding anybody who's worth the job knows that whoever rise your check is the f****** man. You do it that man says because if you don't your ass will be looking for another job and wondering how you're going to pay your bills and nobody wants to deal with that so they do what they're told. That goes for presidents that are owned by corporations because where the f*** does their funding come from. NASA is funded by somebody who ever funds them owns them if they were to dissatisfied the funders there would be no NASA so it's best NASA does what NASA is told by the people who always are funding. This is a corporate ran World owned by corporations who want all of your money. If you do not own your own business you are always beholden to another man and your government but if you own your own business you're only beholden to your government.

There’s not a single reference to a single death that can be directly attributed to a heat wave. Old people died, climate nuts counted every one of them as a victim of the heat wave. This is not science. It’s not intellectually honest. It’s a system of control that can be sold and resold to every generation because of the natural hubris of human beings that allows young people to convince themselves that their generation is the one.. the one that will finally face some faceless malice and only they can be the answer that none of their forebears could see. The climate has always changed, and it always will. Taxes are for controlling people not weather. No one wants to live in a dump. Let free markets and free people solve these problems.

Just make sure to drink a lot of water, stay out of the sun, and invest in an AC unit (and fans) if you don't have one, otherwise you won't be sleeping well at night.

Everyone will have to suck it up and wear thin material, shorts, yes... all the stupid looking clothing.... on your alabaster white bodies. The heat is not fashionable. 

If there's not a lot of humidity to accompany these temps, be thankful. Otherwise you feel like you need a shower after walking outside for two minutes. If you have high humidity then you're experiencing every single summer of mine. Shower. Often.

"Generally speaking, the buildings take longer to cool, but also heat up, due to the amount of thermal mass. So the curve of the inside temperature is shifted. So it is hotter when you come home. In cold winters this saves a lot of money on heating, but now it is starting to become a problem in summer. Before it got to hot these builds where great in summer as well as they where cool in the day and residual heat didn't bother anyone as it dispensed overnight so there was no cumulative heating effect.

The amount of thermal mass would also make regular Aircon a lot more expensive in the older buildings are there is no real isolation barrier. Just thermal mass delaying and leveling out the temperature spike. 

What I do and advocate for people to start doing, is evaporation cooling, once the temperature outside starts to drop, you can remove the residual heat from the building, using evaporation. This removes the cumulative heating effect, so the building does not keep getting hotter and hotter day for day. 

There are evaporation coolers on the market, but a quick wash of wooden floors is more effective (leaving a little more water than normal behind).";0.0;es2t50k;t1_es1rt39;2019-06-26 18:51:58;3.0

In the rural areas houses are designed to maintain the cool air from the morning by using materials such as mud+straw which is very good at insulation and other building techniques that keep indoors very tolerable.

Im from Texas so let me help you out: Get some lotion, start wearing tanktops and shorts, and whatever you do, stay away from wool (I had a wool polo sweater and shit thats a heat sink). The real killer is humidity: you got to find a way to get the moisture out of the air so a dehumidifier and your fan can save you. Start packing extra water bottles in your car, and sleep with a wet cool rag on your chest. While i never had to do any of those, im used to the heat and so i know what helps and what doesnt. If your litterally about to heat up to death, get some icyhot, smear that shit on your chest, and blow a fan on it, as it will cool you down tremendously. Do you have insulation in the walls and in the roof? If so, seal up the house and cool it down, as insulation makes it harder for heat to enter and leave. If your home is not cooling down and it gets way too crazy to bear, get in your car and turn up the AC, although i wouldnt know if thats permitted.;0.0;es29zsm;t1_es1nw0l;2019-06-26 12:59:06;1.0

&#x200B,

This is the absolute key thing America simply *does not get* about Europe (based on my conversations here and elsewhere the past few times heatwaves came up, last I think it was something to do with Australian winters)

Europe *does not do AC*. Of course it *exists* and you'll find most office blocks and hospitals are AC'd to a set temperature. But that's just it, AC exists almost exclusively in professional environments. It would be noticeably *odd* to go round a mates house and hear air conditioning kick in and would probably say more about their character or distinctly personal need to be at a specific temperature all the time.

&#x200B,

Instead our entire infrastructure is built to cope with cold, wet and grey weather. Buildings are solid brick, often double-layered with an insulating pocket. They're terraced and tiled with heavy insulation lining the rafters and, in the UK at least, modern, quicker, flatpack houses are universally panned as shit design because they *don't* hold heat very well.

Housing in Europe is designed to be as watertight and insulating as possible because historically our weather is mostly wet or cold. Hotter countries favour marble and slate flooring to reflect heat and keep the place cooler than outside, but they still build solid and insulated to trap warmth when it gets too cold outside. 

&#x200B,

Yes the summers here are brutal, but just as you say, we *all* have AC. If your AC breaks you can call any of *several* 24 hour AC repairmen. If your AC breaks you can call out from work to deal with the ensuing ""emergency"".

More importantly, every store, hotel, doctors office, whatever has AC.

So I can absolutely understand how hitting those temperatures in areas that don't have ubiquitous AC is an emergency.";0.0;es24i2m;t1_es1nlns;2019-06-26 11:47:53;1.0

These things are only going to become more common, and it's going to take a massive collaborative effort to even stabilize the infrastructure of many countries to account for these changes.

I live in Central Texas, and as a gag gift / stocking stuffer last year my mom decided to buy my wife and I I've scrapers due to increasingly common snowfall / icing.  I've been in Texas for nearly two decades now, and I've been able to get away with using an old credit card to scrape off ice and snow.  Last year we really needed heavier duty tools, such as an ice scraper, but they're near impossible to find in San Antonio, TX due to the perceived lack of need of such a simple item.

"To add to this, if you are not accustomed to AC you don't miss it as much. I live in an American area in southern Germany. I'm from the northern US where AC is unusual. (Well, it's more common now in public places, but when I grew up it wasn't, and it's certainly not in most homes.) We would get 90 and 100 degrees with humidity in the summer, so I am used to what this feels like, but those were the few warmer days, not the norm. I have never experienced a single day living in Germany that I wished for AC. 

But the people in my community from places where AC is normal, like California and Florida, gripe INCESSANTLY every summer about how hot it is and how torturous the lack of AC is and where can they buy a portable unit? Their typical summer day is much hotter than where I grew up, but they are not used to feeling the heat and doing nothing about it, because that could become dangerous. The climate here is not really bad enough to warrant the AC, especially since the buildings are very well made to keep cool, but because they are accustomed to conditioned air it feels less endurable to them. If you come from a place where heat causes danger rather than a little discomfort, not having AC may seem unthinkable.";0.0;es25t0j;t1_es1nlns;2019-06-26 12:04:21;1.0

"Roughly 25% of Australian households don't have AC but there's never a mass amount of casualties. I think a lot of it comes down to education around how to live in the heat. 

When it gets hot in Europe, people tend to go out and sit in the sun all day and not drink a lot of water. In Australia, people don't spend much time in the sun and have water available everywhere as well as wearing hats and always putting on sunscreen. 

Some basic education and preparation can save people from the heat.

I hadn't even considered that places over the pond might not have AC since I grew up in the Midwest, USA.  Here we need both AC and heat in the winter since my area ranges from -teens (colder with windchill) to upper 90's low 100's throughout the year.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave

>The 2003 European heat wave led to the hottest summer on record in Europe since at least 1540.[2] France was hit especially hard. The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a crop shortfall in parts of Southern Europe. Peer-reviewed analysis places the European death toll at more than 70,000.[3] The predominant heat was recorded in July and August, partly a result of the western European seasonal lag from the maritime influence of the Atlantic warm waters in combination with hot continental air and strong southerly winds.

Words mean things. There are no ‘deniers’. That’s a pejorative meant to belittle legitimate skepticism. Science (big S) can’t expect to preach the requirement of skepticism and then bash people that are skeptical. 

I think people are coming around. People in my family that are generally extremely conservative/vote republican are also very conscious of environmental issues and see stewardship as a moral issue. They recycle, use aluminum water bottles, drive generally responsible vehicles, don’t litter, etc...

You’re not going to win anyone over by claiming you know everything (you don’t) and that being skeptical is wrong (it isn’t, and it’s actually encouraged). We all know that our Climate (big C) is not some stationary thing that never changes. We also know about how long the Earth and our existence have been around. We also know that the Earth’s climate fluctuated, often drastically, without nary a human being walking its crust. 

Stop being so combative. That’s not an effective debate technique if you’re trying to influence people to agree with and act on your argument.

Came home from working outside as a tree trimmer and had a nice cold /r/showerbeer [NSFW] every weekday. I sweat constantly at work, and even after my cold shower, until the sun went down and my north-south box fan setup started to do its work. 

But to sweat, you need water.

> The **2003 European heat wave** led to the hottest summer on record in Europe since at least [1540](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1540).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave#cite_note-2) [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) was hit especially hard. The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a [crop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop) shortfall in parts of Southern Europe. Peer-reviewed analysis places the European death toll at more than 70,000.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave#cite_note-3) The predominant heat was recorded in July and August, partly a result of the western European [seasonal lag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag) from the maritime influence of the Atlantic warm waters in combination with hot continental air and strong southerly winds.

> The high number of deaths can be explained by the conjunction of seemingly unrelated events. Most nights in France are cool, even in summer. As a consequence, houses (usually of stone, concrete, or brick construction) do not warm too much during the daytime and radiate minimal heat at night, and air conditioning is usually unnecessary. During the heat wave, temperatures remained at record highs even at night, breaking the usual cooling cycle. Elderly persons living by themselves had never faced such extreme heat before and did not know how to react or were too mentally or physically impaired by the heat to make the necessary adaptations themselves. Elderly persons with family support or those residing in nursing homes were more likely to have others who could make the adjustments for them. This led to statistically improbable survival rates with the weakest group having fewer deaths than more physically fit persons, most of the heat victims came from the group of elderly persons not requiring constant medical care, and/or those living alone, without frequent contact with immediate family.";0.0;es2dtiu;t1_es2atgo;2019-06-26 13:52:26;2.0
Mostly elderly. Ironically, most of the deaths were elderly who were healthier and thus more independent. They had never encountered such a heat wave before, and were already succumbing to heat exhaustion before they could figure out what to do.

As a consequence, houses (usually of stone, concrete, or brick construction) do not warm too much during the daytime and radiate minimal heat at night, and air conditioning is usually unnecessary. During the heat wave, temperatures remained at record highs even at night, breaking the usual cooling cycle. Elderly persons living by themselves had never faced such extreme heat before and did not know how to react or were too mentally or physically impaired by the heat to make the necessary adaptations themselves. Elderly persons with family support or those residing in nursing homes were more likely to have others who could make the adjustments for them.

40 degrees celsius with low humidity is a lot less dangerous than 40 degrees celsius with high humidity. With low humidity, you start sweating and the sweat leaves your pores and then evaporates into the air. With high humidity, there's already so much water concentrated in the air that the sweat doesn't evaporate as easily off of your skin, leaving it to clog your pores which makes it harder for the body to regulate the heat, leading to overheating and eventually heat strokes. This usually happens more to older people, but heatstrokes are 30-40% lethal iirc (don't quote me on that).;0.0;es2sutz;t1_es2s8v8;2019-06-26 18:44:28;2.0

It's a measure of the temperature at which evaporation can no longer lower temperature relative to a temperature measure in the shade. 

Without evaporation by sweating, a high a wet bulb temperature can easily drive body heat above survivable limits. This explains how 15,000 people died in France in 2003, even though temperatures seemed relatively low compared to high dry heat.

"Problem is, our houses here in northern Europe are *designed to retain heat*.

For the more vulnerable (particular for older people who have nobody to look out for them), over days/weeks of sustained heat, I can certainly believe the death toll can reach that.

"TLDR: Complicated stats. 

&#x200B,

Let's take an easy example: If you lived in a town of 10,000 people, and every year around 80 people died or so per year, but last year, 1876 people died, you'd ask, ""What the hell happened last year?"" and you'd likely come up with an obvious answer (a horrific plague).

&#x200B,

Determining excess deaths is the above process, but with less extreme differences between normal and abnormal and more factors.

&#x200B,

It's also important to point out that the mechanism of death is often obvious here. Dehydration and heat injury have easily measured, short term effects on someone's health, so this isn't a complicated long term process (like carcinogens) but often, ""Heat stroke causes even healthy adults to have a racing heart rate. The 70 year old woman with a history of cardiac disease got the same symptoms everyone has but worse and died.""

&#x200B,

Keep in mind that the real answer is going to be a confidence interval, but they round because ""Around 15,000 deaths"" is less of a mouthful than, ""Between 13,723 and 16,277 excess mortalities vs the seasonally adjusted average with a 95% confidence interval.""";0.0;es1rxxf;t1_es1l5fn;2019-06-26 09:10:08;2.0

"Idk if this helps or not, but I have an analogy. Have you ever got a store bought smoothy with mango in? (I promise this is relevant)

Usually, even if mango is in the name, not much is in the drink. I (and I assume other people too) may look at the label and go "" what the fuck, how dare you cost so much more than normal juice when there is so little of the ""exotic"" fruit in there?"" 

And there's an easy to see answer, which also applies to CO2 in the atmosphere. A little mango makes a big change to the taste - adding only a little means you can taste it a lot, and adding lots is overwhelming. In the same way, CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas. Even if it is only 0.04% of the atmosphere, less than a century or two ago (so, very recently from the earth's point of view) it used to be less than 0.03%. 

In relative terms, to jump up over 1/3 in concentration is huge, hence the big issues it will cause.

"A retired  5 star general came to my grad school 8 years ago. His new job was leading an international disaster first response team. 

Part of their job was also working in predictive analysis. He told us that drought and climate change related mass migration was predicted within a decade, and that we would begin to to see global ramifications as entire populations ran out of water and fled their homelands in crisis. He emphasized that as this began to happen, it would destabilize entire regions and have a major global impact that he and his team, at least, were preparing for. 

He encouraged us to do everything we could to mitigate climate change at all levels..and to be prepared for drought related unrest. Definitely the most sobering and memorable lecture of my life.

But that's not the crazy part. The crazy part was that the numbers on it (plastic) starting to ""drool"" a bit (not sure what the English word for it is). Like, the bars and numbers were bending. So yeah, it was so crazily hot it weakened our thermometer to such a point that gravity alone was enough to do that.

And to be fair, it was a cheap ass thermometer, plus although it was placed more or less in the shadow, maybe some sunbeams hit it directly for a few minutes or something. But when we looked at it it was in the shadow and it still said 50+ degrees.

Yup cheap ACs that work start at 800€ but they also need to be installed - I did some research on that. I know fans do not decrease the room temperature but they still provide a cooling effect, it's the same as if you were e.g. riding a bicycle and profiting from the airflow. My grandmother used fans and so I am I now. If you tactically position them around places where you're often, that really can make a large difference.  Order three big standing/tower fans and just see if it makes a difference?

Also don't get cheap fans with plastic blades, a good metal bladed fan gets better speeds which means more airflow - and never forget to wipe the fan blades down with a lightly damp cloth every few weeks. Dust accumulation makes a real (negative) difference.

"If you're unable to sleep from being too warm, you can always try the Egyption Blanket, which is a technique used for thousands of years in the desert.

Basically you open all your windows (or turn on fans, whatever, but you need moving air in your bedroom.)

Then you lay a thick towel on top of your bed. (it's just there to keep your bed dry.) You lay on top of that towel, and for a ""blanket"" you use a wet linen.

The linen shouldn't be dripping wet, but it should be quite moist. With that as a blanket, you're going to get a little damp yourself, and the moisture evaporating will lower the temperature all around the ""blanket"". A wet linen will last 3-4 hours before drying so it can keep you cool for quite a long time. By the time it dries, it will be far late at night, where it's cool enough that you might actually want a real blanket... which is handy because as you sleep the linen tries and basically turns itself into a blanket just in time for you to need it at 5am or whatever.

Unfortunately this doesn't work in really humid climates (sorry Florida), but if you're in an sudden heat wave and the humidity isn't too bad, the egyptian blanket can be extremely effective and it uses extremely basic supplies.";0.0;es24ubi;t1_es1ri3r;2019-06-26 11:52:16;3.0

"Some hopefully helpful tips,

Fans with metal blades and grids can be a little cooler

Also have it blow on feet the most, if your feet cool down then the rest of you cools down faster

Put dark curtains up. Less light, more cool.

Put bowls of ice cubes around the room and in front of fans, never helped cool a room down for me but if it helps

Also don't check the temperature, keep it outta sight, makes life easier when you're trying to feel cool

Something a bit absurd that I've done is get a thin shirt, not like skinny but like thin enough you can see nipples through it, something that lets breezes through easy, then soak it in water, put it on and lay in front of the fan.

"Here in Madrid I think it's the hottest place currently, with predictions of 42° until Monday, I had my air con on for about 30 mins this afternoon and about 30 mins mid evening. (just on dry, rather than cool). 

But, what you REALLY need to do whether you have air con or not...

Close your curtains during the day! 

Here everyone closes the metal shutters over the windows all day, or closes the curtains if they don't have shutters. You'd be surprised but it almost totally stops the rooms getting warm. Half the people here don't even use their air con, if they have it at all. Its not really necessary except in offices etc. 

(that said, it's a very dry desert heat here, not particularly humid most of the time).

You always see Texans on here saying how everyone needs aircon this, and everyone needs aircon that... 

Its simply not true, everyone needs buildings which aren't made to American standards, and shutters on their windows.

Having been to texas through the summer, it's really no big deal there, if they turned their air con off once in a while they would get used to the heat and not rely on it so much.

I have big floor to ceiling windows in my livingroom which don't have shutters, but there's a tree outside so it's mostly OK. The other rooms are all shuttered.

&#x200B,

It's actually hilarious they are building roads in Labrador lately and they need so much maintenance from being covered with tons of ice and snow and the ground repeatedly freezing and melting. It's easier to get around the Big Land in the winter when the snow makes a road anywhere you want to go, even over the bay when the ice freezes. But in summer you have to walk over a rocky tundra full of flies, or drive dusty bumpy roads with pot holes big enough to lose a moose.

&#x200B,

* Make sure to keep sunlight out. Curtains do not help, as sunlight is already indoors at that point producing heat. Use outside blinds if you have them. If not, tape Aluminium foil to the outside of your windows.  Especially on the south side of your house.
* Do not cook indoors. Put a BBQ outside or put some camping gear outside to cook. It also prevents the humidity from rising further indoors.
* Turn off all non-essential electronics. They generate heat.
* Keep you windows closed during the day. Open them up wide during the night when the temperature outside is lower then inside. Point fans at the open windows to force airflow if needed. Preferably also use some mesh screens in your windows to keep bugs out.

"Two simple steps:
1) Cut all fossil fuel subsidies.
2) Issue carbon taxes with teeth (I would say at least $40 per ton.

That alone will make fossil fuel no longer competitive against solar or wind.

As for the intermittency problem with solar and wind, battery technology is progressing very rapidly. Plus there are potential other storage methods. Take for example ammonia (NH3). Can be made from air and water and a lot of energy, so once solar becomes 2-4 times cheaper than now (see Swanson's law), we can generate and store ammonia for seasonal deficiencies.

The nice thing with ammonia is that we already produce it on a vast industrial scale. It would be a matter of doubling or quadrupling ammonia production to solve (most of) grid storage issues.";0.0;es2kur7;t1_es1zsq7;2019-06-26 15:47:33;6.0

I'll try to explain it as best as my non-medical self can. To use an analogy, you know how you aren't supposed to put cold water on a burn? It causes the skin to shred itself. When you are overheated and go to drink cold water or dunk yourself in cold water, you are more likely to send yourself into shock, which can then results in all sorts of damage. When you put cold water on a burn... That area is going into a type of shock! It's similar as to when you have a really high fever - don't drink cold water or take a cold bath to bring the fever down. You should stick with lukewarm water, or else you can go into shock. I hope that explains it decent enough, but hopefully someone more inclined to these things can provide some input.

Another good analogy is to think of the radiator on your motor vehicle - don't put cold water in it 'cuz it'll jack it all up. You drink water to regulate your body temperature...

"You are wrong on the humidity part. Dew point is a measure of absolute humidity and more closely tracks perception of humidity. Current dew point outside my house in Texas is 24C, south Texas has a dew point of 27C. For comparison, current dew point in Paris is 18C. Turin has the highest dew point in Europe, 24C.

Not to say that your experience is not miserable. It got below freezing here last year and it sucked. My office doesnt have heat so it was just cold. Temperature extremes are miserable. I just wanted to point out the humidity thing because I saw it repeated a lot in this thread. US humidity extremes are almost certainly worse than anything in Europe, but unlike Europe, we are prepared and acclimated for it. 

People have ACs here so its much more bearable. In the past, I lived here without AC. It wasnt fun, but I was young and used to the heat so it wasnt too bad. The key is knowing how to deal with it.

"The dictionary defines a *denialist* as *""a person who refuses to admit the truth of a concept or proposition that is supported by the majority of scientific or historical evidence.""*

&nbsp,

Denial is a thing. And 'scientific skepticism' requires one to be skeptical of arguments both *for and against* a position, applying the methods of science and critically evaluating evidence.

It is **not** sufficient to say ""man-made climate change is a hoax because the climate always changes"", as that's denial.

&nbsp,

Further, deniers usually show a number of these traits:

- using false experts

- using logical inconsistencies

- having impossible expectations of science

- cherry-picking data

- resorting to conspiracy theories

And trying to have a rational argument, with someone who's in denial, is futile.

Growth is mandated by the system itself. And it is out of control and has been so for near 3 decades. If you check my page again you will see the link providing information regarding the sustainable resource limits of this earth, once past those sustainable limits we degrade the ecological systems of the earth to such a point that they cannot recover from the damage being done in any useful time as far as humans are concearned.


We are taking 80 billion tonnes of ""stuff"" per year from a world that can only sustain 50 billion tonnes. And due to capitalism that rate of consumption near doubles over 30 year periods, meaning by 2050 we will be taking close to 150 billion tonnes of stuff from a world that can only sustain 50 billion tonnes. This rate and type of consumption that capitalism both demands, and depends on for its very survival and viability, will finish us as a complex advanced organised species.

A carbon tax is utterly useless under capitalism, as all that will happen is smaller firms will struggle to pay it and be put into easier positions for large corps to buy them out. 

The large corps will then merge their operations and pay what ever the hell is needed to continue doing what ever it is they are doing as it is profitable and no tax will ever be more than the profits available for carrying on regardless.

And as stated, a carbon tax does nothing to lower consumption of goods and services, incentivised of all people by capitalism, every minute of every day. 

Carbon tax = tinkering at the edges. You cannot regulate an infinite growth economic system into compliance with the physics of a finite world.

As for getting off world, no one will be on Mars before 2050 at the earliest and it will be a tiny handful of people.

Only been to France a couple times so can't say for sure if this is common.  But last time I was there I stayed in a high end (400 euro a night) hotel in Marseilles.  After I checked in it was warm in my room and after messing with the thermostat for 10 minutes I called the front desk and told them I couldn't figure out how to turn on the A/C.  The guy at the front desk told me I have to open the window.  So ... Here I am opening and closing the windows thinking maybe they have a sensor on it that prevents you from wasting energy or something.  Still couldn't figure it out.  Call again and the guy tells me.  No.  You open the window and get the breeze off the sea.  Fuck that. I gotta breathe salty humid ocean air, can't sleep cause it's hot, and there are people making noise outside but I'll die if I close the window.

That is STILL an example of using one data point to provide evidence for a long term trend. It doesn’t matter if the data point is on one end of a curve, using that single data point as evidence of a trend is as invalid as using any single data point as evidence of the opposite.

"Well, the thing with AC is... it is great! But, there is a serious problem if we do not get other things fixed first:

 

>In hot summer weather, and as heat waves are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change, there is no question that air conditioning does and will save lives, says Jonathan Patz, a senior author of the study and a UW-Madison professor of environmental studies and population health sciences.  
>  
>However, he cautions that if the increased use of air conditioning due to climate change depends on power derived from fossil fuels, there will be an air quality and human health tradeoff. ""We're trading problems,"" says Patz, an expert on climate change and human health. ""Heat waves are increasing and increasing in intensity. We will have more cooling demand requiring more electricity. But if our nation continues to rely on coal-fired power plants for some of our electricity, each time we turn on the air conditioning we'll be fouling the air, causing more sickness and even deaths.""

So, if we feed our AC with power that is produced by plants that add to the problem of climate change, we only make things worse. It is a vicious circle!

So a good strategy would be buying a dehumidifier. It's multiple times cheaper than a proper AC system, one costs about as much as a mid-range smartphone. As long as the air is dry enough, just dousing yourself constantly will make even temperatures of 40-45 C tolerable.;0.0;es1ttun;t1_es1ofd6;2019-06-26 09:33:27;2.0

Because they are. People share common traits though. The difference between governments and businesses is that businesses must earn and retain customers. Governments face much less accountability and thus have less incentive to produce desirable results. If corporations are controlled by people who desire money and power, and governments are controlled by people who desire money and power, why do you trust one and not the other? Personally, I trust those who have earned my trust. Government fails every time. At least some of the time (some would argue most of the time) businesses act in good faith out of a sincere desire to deliver value to customers. Governments face  no or little accountability for failing in this regard.;0.0;es2278y;t1_es21qo9;2019-06-26 11:18:54;-2.0

"> They can spare that many people.

Do you know what dying from dehydration is like ?

Have you ever seen someone close to death from it ?

It's not pretty.

And it's agonizing.

There was a story that came out months and months ago, of a woman in China who got on an elevator in a nearly abandoned apartment complex.  Nearly, but not completely.  Some people still lived there.

While she's in between floors, technicians cut off power to the elevator, to do some work elsewhere.  They weren't working on the elevator, and no one was nearby.

They left, and forgot to turn power back on.

When they came back *one month later,* and turned on power then, they made a grim discovery.

The woman had been trapped in a metal encased area that blocked cellphone signals.

Her fingernails had broken off on the seams of the doors.

It took *days* for her to slowly run out of water in her body, until finally, all alone in the dark, death finished her off.

Would you want anyone to have to experience that, now that you know what they're in for ?";0.0;es2it6s;t1_es2e37e;2019-06-26 15:11:23;9.0

Bobby is right at 3pm in the Summer here,  but its actually more environmentally friendly to live in Phoenix than most of the rest of the US. It simply takes less energy to run an AC compressor 5-6 months in Phoenix than to provide heat 6-8 months in the north or Midwest.

This hasn't even been a bad summer in Arizona this year. We've had like one hot week and the rest has been pretty bearable so far. But yeah, especially in Phoenix at night the heat just radiates back up out of the ground and concrete and asphalt at night so it doesn't really ever cool off like outside the city. You can feel it coming out of the ground. Lows in the 90s aren't uncommon and then the sun comes up and bakes everything all over again.

If you really need to get that temp down, using rubbing alcohol instead.

"And don't forget: most households or buildings in France - even in Southern France - do NOT have AC.

EDIT: For those asking why: because up to fairly recently, it simply wasn't necessary. Buildings in France are built out of stone/concrete/brick masonry, and some old houses have thick walls, and those would naturally insulate against heat. But temps have been out of control in the past decade or so. Window units are not common and are not designed for French-style windows.

In France (and many European countries), the two main options for AC are either portable/mobile units (which are not very effective), or ductless systems (which are based on a heat pump), which are becoming more common in some recently built or renovated houses (or in some businesses), but they're very expensive.

Up until very recently, AC just wasn't necessary. You'd get hot a couple of weeks a year but you'd survive it with a small sweat. With the climate getting fucked up, the new normal is tearing that apart. Most people who suffer in this heat are senior citizens, and many are in facilities or housing that simply don't make it easy or affordable for them to get access to cooling.";0.0;es1wyuu;t1_es1vs7h;2019-06-26 10:13:04;758.0

You need to be in good enough shape to take the shocks on your body when the heat waves become a reoccurring thing, each one lasting longer than before, and the heat rising.

It's going to take *time* for humanity to react to this.  Be it build underground cities, carbon sequestration, radiation reflection, or any other mitigation... including day / night inversion, where society operates at night, and everyone sleeps in the day.

Whatever is figured out, or attempted, will take time to spin up, to get it working, or even begin to have an effect.

"OR...get a good sized window unit in your bedroom. Close the door and close the blinds/shutters/drapes in any other windows. A window unit isn’t too expensive, and will get a bedroom sized room COLD if you keep it running. They are loud, but you get used to it.

I’ve lived in a few houses that have no AC in the Deep South of the US where summertime temps easily get up above 100 for the month of August and are in the low to upper 90s the rest of the summer. A window unit in the bedroom and a window unit in the living room or wherever you spend the rest of your time are all you really need to stay comfortable.

And for god sakes, utilize the thermostat on the unit and let it run even if you aren’t home. I don’t know if it’s cheaper or more expensive to do it that way, but I do know it’s easier to keep the place cool if you just let the AC run whether you are home or not. It takes a while to pump out all that hot air and you’ll be sweating your balls off waiting for the AC to cool things down.

Oh!! Also ceiling fans. Install a couple of ceiling fans to keep the air moving around the house. If you’ve got a couple of window units you can keep the doors to those rooms open at night sometimes and the fans do a pretty good job of circulating the cool air around the house. Ceiling fans are cheap and easy to install. Every room in my house (and every other house in the south) has a ceiling fan.

There are other things you can do to keep cool if you don’t have AC...some old school tricks my parents used in the American south before there was AC that were passed down through the generations. If you have 2 windows in your room, open the top of one and the bottom of the other. This will create a circulation pattern that pulls hot air away from the ceiling and out the top of one window while pulling in cooler night time air through the bottom of other window. It works enough to keep the room from being stifling. This next one is weird sounding, but my mom and her sister lived the first 20 years of their lives doing it. Before bed, take your top sheet from your bed, and soak it in cool water then ring it out as best you can so it’s just barely damp. Wear thin, minimal clothing to bed and sleep under the damp sheet. It will keep you cool as the water evaporates out of it all night. It will more then likely be dry in the morning by the time you wake up. Likewise you can soak a thin sheet or piece of muslin and tack it in an open window so the breeze has to blow through the damp sheet. The evaporation will cool the breeze considerably as it comes through the window.

To summarize, yes, in the US we have Central AC everywhere now but people have lived here for thousands of years before AC and with a few tricks have done just fine. With some imagination and ingenuity so can you and it will be autumn before you know it. Good luck Euro friends!";0.0;es255kx;t1_es1tydg;2019-06-26 11:56:12;1.0

"If you're unable to sleep from being too warm, you can always try the *Egyption Blanket*, which is a technique used for thousands of years in the desert. 

Basically you open all your windows (or turn on fans, whatever, but you need moving air in your bedroom.)

Then you lay a thick towel on top of your bed. (it's just there to keep your bed dry.) You lay on top of that towel, and for a ""blanket"" you use a wet linen.

The linen shouldn't be dripping wet, but it should be quite moist. With that as a blanket, you're going to get a little damp yourself, and the moisture evaporating will lower the temperature all around the ""blanket"". A wet linen will last 3-4 hours before drying so it can keep you cool for quite a long time. By the time it dries, it will be far late at night, where it's cool enough that you might actually want a real blanket... which is handy because as you sleep the linen tries and basically turns itself into a blanket just in time for you to need it at 5am or whatever.

Unfortunately this doesn't work in really humid climates (sorry Florida), but if you're in an sudden heat wave and the humidity isn't *too* bad, the egyptian blanket can be extremely effective and it uses extremely basic supplies.";0.0;es249td;t1_es1v084;2019-06-26 11:45:00;55.0

This isn’t entirely accurate.  The issue is that heat accumulated in the home (cooking, body heat, appliances etc.) and because they’re designed to keep it in, it doesn’t dissipate.

"Not quite. The greenhouse effect of sunlight entering through your windows and heating up your room is not mirrored in winter, because radiative heat is a thing but radiative cold is not. A lot of places will have doubly isolated windows, but not all places will have the blinds on the outside/in-between the double windows (curtains are more common), so the radiative heat usually gets in and is absorbed.

And in Northern Europe most houses are designed with windows facing south specifically to catch as much light as possible.";0.0;es1qmdr;t1_es1oog5;2019-06-26 08:54:00;494.0

"Problem is if I keep the windows shut and the curtains closed sunlight will still heat up the room and it gets stifling. It feels like an oven behind the curtains and the heat gradually radiates into the room. We have double brick walls with cavity insulation so after a few hours it is cooler outside than inside and opening the windows is necessary.

What I would like is the wooden shutters on the outside like a lot of places in France have. Last year I was looking to see if I could find something to coat the windows with to reflect more sunlight but as I grow plants on the windowsill I wanted something temporary that could be easily removed when it wasn't so hot. I went with just using cardboard from boxes and taping it inside the glass to keep the sun out. A couple layers of cardboard and no heat was getting through the glass.";0.0;es1tfe3;t1_es1oog5;2019-06-26 09:28:27;5.0
Not at all because if it keeps heat inside as well as ours do just your body heat plus the warmth from the walls and windows equal warmer inside than outside in all climates.

exactly this.    The only difference between the two is you'll want some kind of solar curtains in the windows to reflect heat back out in the summer.  Even if you have the ability to cool your home with air conditioning... decent blinds & insulation will save you a pile of money and either reduce how much it has to run, or help keep your place a bit more comfortable if the AC can't keep up.;0.0;es1pp19;t1_es1oog5;2019-06-26 08:42:50;3.0

"Not really.  You can specifically design a house whereas in the winter the lower elevation sun levels hit inside the house through windows and skylights.

I wouldn't place the emphasis on older buildings. You tend to find newer construction is a lot worse. A lot of older buildings with thick masonry walls have excellent insulation and airflow, they were built before central heating and air conditioning were a consideration and do very well in extreme temperatures. On the flip side later construction especially crap from the 60/70's/80's can be utterly shit at handling temperature shifts.

Most people aren’t republican or democrat. Most people believe climate change is real. And just because someone disagrees with you on one thing, that doesn’t make them your enemy.

"Europe has terrible infrastructure for heat. Homes are built to withstand harsh winters. Meaning they insulate the hell out of them. During a long lasting heat wave such as this, this results in it typically being hotter inside the home than outside. They also don't mass produce air conditioners there. Because they are rarely used. Couple that with the large humidity numbers (pushing 50 - 60%), then you have a recipe for disaster. Have you ever been to the tropics? Even in the shade, a hot summers day can kill you while you sleep despite having plenty of water. 

This is because humidity keeps you from sweating efficiently. Your sweat just doesn't evaporate off your skin as quickly because there is too much water in the air. This evaporation is critical to carrying heat *off* the body and into the air. At a certain tipping point, the humidity and heat simply overwhelm the body, and the body takes on more heat than it could dissipate. This means the body heats up, regardless of being at rest and well hydrated. Think of a hot-humid sauna. Eventually your body will give up regardless of how much water you've drank despite being indoors. 

Take a look at this [heat index] (https://www.iweathernet.com/wxnetcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/heat-index-chart-relative-humidity-2.png) chart. France is in the purple areas right now. 'Exposure' is not meant to be interpreted as exposure to the sun, just the heat. Its 90F+ with 50% humidity **within** peoples homes right now because they have poor heat resistant/ AC supporting infrastructure. This tipping point is lower for the elderly and sick because they're bodies have compromised cooling systems due to aged/impaired biology. There are A LOT of old people in Europe.

So in summary:

* It's hot as balls out there on any counts. I live in SOCAL, and 104 F is HOT.
* It's as humid as a wet towel, compromising bodies thermal efficiency. 
* No one has AC. Not even public places such as malls, most hospitals etc.
* The inside of homes eventually get hotter than the outside.
* Sick/Elderly people don't have the means of transportation. Meaning they can only stay home and hunker down.
* Emergency services have zero experience in dealing with heat related illnesses. The crews themselves are struggling to stay cool.

"Most of what you said here is just not true.

> Growth is mandated by the system itself.

Growth is something every living thing evolves, because it is essential to survival. 

> And it is out of control and has been so for near 3 decades.

3 decades? That's a completely arbitrary number, global warming has been out of control for much long, mass extinction even longer, and we turned the Middle East/North Africa into a desert thousands of years ago. All caused by out of control growth.

> If you check my page again you will see the link providing information regarding the sustainable resource limits of this earth

You mean that poorly written wordpress page with no sources, and as many factual inaccuracies as you? No thanks.

> We are taking 80 billion tonnes of ""stuff"" per year from a world that can only sustain 50 billion tonnes.

Utter nonsense. We're not taking it to another planet. It's not magically disapearing. It's still here. Helium and hydrogen the only exception.s It just floats out into space. And I do agree that we should be conserving helium in particular.

> And due to capitalism that rate of consumption near doubles over 30 year periods

That's because of human nature more than anything. Communist countries always still try to grow.

> A carbon tax is utterly useless under capitalism, as all that will happen is smaller firms will struggle to pay it and be put into easier positions for large corps to buy them out. 

You couldn't be more wrong. When carbon is priced, so is transportation. It encourages more local business. Small companies pollute less, meaning small companies pay less. You can also just say that small businesses don't have to pay it. The straw man you created is not the only possible way to do a carbon tax.

> The large corps will then merge their operations and pay what ever the hell is needed to continue doing what ever it is they are doing as it is profitable and no tax will ever be more than the profits available for carrying on regardless.

They're going to pay more money to be more profitable? I don't think you understand what capitalism is. Only the most profitable companies survive, if a company can't adapt they don't stay profitable long, and go out of business. The idea that all companies would just ignore something that's losing them many is not just completely wrong, but is incredibly stupid.

> And as stated, a carbon tax does nothing to lower consumption of goods and services, incentivised of all people by capitalism, every minute of every day. 

All price increases lower consumption.

> Carbon tax = tinkering at the edges. You cannot regulate an infinite growth economic system into compliance with the physics of a finite world.

I already addressed this, I'll say it again: the world is finite, but we will not be stuck on this world much longer. Infinite growth is a property of life, not capitalism.

> As for getting off world, no one will be on Mars before 2050 at the earliest and it will be a tiny handful of people.

Wet bulb temperature is great at representing how hot something feels, because 40 degrees in a dry climate will allow you to sweat, will be survivable, and will feel a lot less horrible than 35 degrees in 100% humidity.

Once wet bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees, your body cannot really get rid of heat faster than it generates it. Your body temperature rises until something fails and your body stops generating heat (because you're dead).";0.0;es1ummr;t1_es1tmca;2019-06-26 09:43:34;3.0

"I agree with most of your perspective here. Carbon tax is a way to make renewables like electric vehicles, cost competitive. Paying for our carbon usage is a way to get people to reduce their usage, but it does impact the working class and poor much more than the wealthy. A flat rate carbon tax probably isn’t the answer. It’s a difficult scenario that requires more in depth analysis than I care to try to discuss via Reddit comment. Not all conservatives are against though.

"You got used to it because it was all the time. A heatwave of 114 degrees from the statistical norm of around 75 at this time is pretty fucking drastic. Even if they lived in Paris their entire life, this is not normal. People die when they are put in places they aren't prepared for. I have lived in MA for most of my life and summer days rarely get over 95. If I were to go Texas where it's 110 and tried to do what I do in MA, I would stand a good chance of getting heat stroke. The difference is that I wouldn't try to run around the beach all day because I actively went somewhere that it's hotter and realize that's dumb. If it were 110 for 3-4 days and I had to go to work, I would have no idea what to do differently. I would still get right in my car and drive off, I would still walk
my dog, I would still go to the gym and so on. In France, a lot of people walk to work. That's dangerous in 114 degree heat, but they aren't going to chance their entire week for it. They also don't have AC. It's just like not a thing there.

3. Even so, the cost you are observing in France now does not reflect the increased demand due to the use of wide-spread home air conditioning.

"Indira Gandhi (no relation to Mahatma) *tried* to implement a ""voluntary-sterilization-for-money-and-nice-gifts"" policy, however the policy's combination of strict quotas workers had to satisfy to get paid by the government and most Indian people's refusal to voluntarily get sterilization surgery in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s before climate change was causing widespread devastation meant that tons of Indians were instead *forced* to go under the knife, which really caused sterilization programs to leave a bad taste in many peoples' mouths. Also, many Indians who got sterilized, voluntary and forced alike, suffered due to the typical rushed, shitty sterilization jobs not done under adequate sanitary/antiseptic conditions.

"Poor American here, my ac broke down last July and I didn't have the cash to replace it right away. So I got one of those small portable ac units, not the window ones, but one on wheels. It's only enough for one or two rooms, so I just moved it I to the bedroom at night, and the study during the day.

You need to be able to vent the heat outside though, and that's tricky. You don't want to vent it back in to another room, that's not efficient at all, it's got to go out a window. I made a cardboard attachment out of the box that was the same size as the screen in my windows. Then I mounted the exhaust vent to that. So I could move the unit, and move the exhaust.

The issue is less the a/c cost but more the power they need. In most of Europe we pay much, much more for power than the US.

You could try an air cooler. It's definitely not on the same level as A/C but for like £50 you can get something significantly more powerful and effective than a fan.

That being said, don't buy a shitty cheap ac unit, it just isn't worth it. Ours is a big inverter split system type wall unit and knocks out heat or cold in the loungeroom/dining/kitchen area within minutes.

ftr using a few window units a couple times a week is less effecient then constantly running a modern HVAC unit in a new house that is well insulated, especially if the new house also has thermal courtains inside as well. We recently got my old house resided and reinsulated with Concrete siding, Tyvek and all the other good stuff and got a new HVAC unit with a built in dehumidifier that runs pretty consistently (new HVAC systems are designed to have fan going almost all the time in the summer.) Previously we'd just run the old one during super hot weather and would also run some window units/dehumidifiers now and then. The decrease in electricity useage was pretty massive, and we have our AC set to 71/72 in the summer, I think with the old system we'd have it at 76/77, but it's been a bit.;0.0;es1s7dk;t1_es1kwy7;2019-06-26 09:13:21;5.0

"So long as you are maintaining your temperature, I imagine drinking cold water is fine. My main concern is regarding whether or not you are *overheated.* That's the important factor to consider. Are you dizzy? Feel a little funny? Nauseous, even a little? Feel like something just isn't right? Is your face and skin more red than it should be, not from sunburn?


Here's someone's account on what happened when they drank cold water quickly after being overheated: [here](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/drinking-cold-water-hot-day-1777573) I've seen this account on a few different sites, but this was the most detailed.


I'm trying feverishly to find something relating as to why you shouldn't drink cold water when you're overheated, but apparently there hasn't been enough studies done on those who are already falling ill from being overheated. Much like you shouldn't plop a fevered child into a cold bath, you wouldn't do the same to yourself.


Otherwise, it'd be my personal experiences to help account for this. While I don't think I've sent myself into shock, I have definitely made myself more sick drinking ice cold water when overheated. My mom suffered from heat exhaustion and hopped into the shower to try to cool off. She nearly passed out from the cold on her skin - thankfully I was in the bathroom with her to make sure she was alright and got her to turn the cold water down. Once you get yourself to a more stabilized temperature and no longer feel ill, cold water is fine.

"If you look at my original comment - I said you cannot use this one summer as an example of climate change. 

You countered with a trend.

I didn’t say, a trend cannot be used as an example of climate change - that’s actually the exact opposite of what I was originally saying. 

However, what you also can’t do, is say that this one summer fits into the trend, therefore, you can conclude that this one summer is an example of climate change. No, the one summer by itself is still only a single data point. It’s absolutely meaningless to point to this one summer in Europe and say, yup, this is climate change at work. It’s not. If you eliminated this one summer - say it was the coldest summer on record for the past 1500 years, would that negate climate change? Nope. 

Really all you can say is - look, where are all the temperatures for the last 500 or 1000 years - this is evidence of climate change (actually, that’s only evidence of relatively short term climate change, because of how far our weather records go back).

"You're only looking at 170 years. Climate change (real climate change, not anthropomorphic global warming) works on a MUCH longer time scale.

The Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the [Quaternary Ice Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation). The ice sheets we still have are remnants of the last glacial period. The continents are *still* [rebounding ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237276581_Global_glacial_isostasy_and_the_surface_of_the_ice-age_Earth) from their weight. They should go away at the interglacial peak, and then the cycle of cooling will start again. This occurs over 100k years. For us that would be ""permanent"" since our lifetimes are so short. Six thousand years ago the Sahara was a tropical grassland, before that a verdant forest. These changes will occur no matter what we put into the atmosphere or not. 

Now is adding what is relatively minuscule amounts of CO2, methane, etc...possibly speeding up this natural warming trend? Probably, however the Earth would still be warming up regardless of what we do or don't do. 

There was a major warming trend about 12,000 y.a. as the glaciers receded. This is when the Neolithic ""Agricultural"" Revolution began. The warming was a good thing that advanced human civilizations around the world. 

It's best to look at actual climate changes on Earth using geological time scales, not human time scales.

Now, why then is this idea of anthropomorphic global warming being pushed? Look at, for example, climate plans from politicians. To meet their goals you have to hand over to governments, bloated bureaucratic governments, a lot of personal freedom and money in the form of taxes. Many climate researchers get their [grant money](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays) ultimately from [governments](https://www.gao.gov/key_issues/climate_change_funding_management/issue_summary). 

As a researcher, you might be inclined to make sure your results give them what they want. Not everyone would be, and yes, you can correlate an increase in greenhouse gas emissions to global temperature changes.

Again, however, if you don't add in that the Earth would be getting warmer anyway, how can you be for sure? My issue with these scientists and politicians is that they are not informing the public of the big picture.";0.0;es6mwvd;t1_es50g9s;2019-06-28 02:28:09;0.0

"You're not dumb for not knowing celsius. Most of you guys were never taught celsius in school, and you don't use it in your everyday life.

However it would be nice for Americans to learn celsius so they can communicate better with... the entire rest of the world. ,)

Here's a guide for doing rough conversions in your head:

* Meters and yards are roughly the same.
* Celsius to farenheit: -40 is the same in both scales. Then for every 10C there is about 18F (or for every 18F there is about 10C). The formula is Cx1.8 (so in your head double it and then take away a little), then add 32 = F.
* 0 is freezing point. 10 is a cold day. 20 is a nice day. 30 is a hot day. 40 is really hot summer day. 100 is boiling point. 150 is a low oven. 180 a normal oven. 200 a hot oven.
* Kilometers to miles: take away half plus a bit more. Eg: 100km is 60mi.
* Miles to kilometers: times it by 1.6. 100mi = 160km. Basically add 60% on top.
* Centimeters to inches: halve it and then take away a bit more. 1cm = 0.4in.
* Inches to centimeters: times it by 2.5. 1in = 2.5cm.
* Kilograms to pounds: double it and then add a little bit. 70kg = 154lbs.
* Pounds to kilos: halve it and take away a little bit. 200lbs = 91kg, 2lbs = 0.9kg.
* Litres to gallons, divide it by 4. Eg: 1L = 0.2 gallons.
* 1 litre is 33 US fluid ounces. Not sure how to help with this one.";0.0;es333jf;t1_es1z372;2019-06-26 22:26:06;1.0

Also, it won't be that hot in France. The temperatures that France are getting are 100%  survivable for all humans, and most other animals. 

The problem is first, the adjustment period, it takes people two weeks for their bodies to become normalized to temperature changes. During rapid temperature changes this doesn't happen.

Secondly, people in France just don't have the experience in how to act in heat like this. If you don't know what heat stroke feels like, and you like to think you're a badass, you're probably gonna try and work through it, and then you'll die. For example.

 Also, most of France probably doesn't have AC in their homes, because until global warming happened they didn't need it.

I'm going on my personal instinct that the models are accelerated much faster than is reported by the IPCC.

They gave the most conservative timetables, about when they are *certain* these things will happen.  But that unfortunately was done so that deniers couldn't point to more realistic timetables and say ""well you guys aren't *sure* so there's nothing to worry about.""

Fuck the deniers, an *evolutionary correction* is about to occur.  It's no longer about trying to convince *everybody.*  It's now Darwin in action and those who take this seriously and adapt to absorb the shock are going to be the ones carrying the human race though this.

This is not the *first* time something like this has happened.

In everyone's DNA, is evidence that eons ago, humanity was reduced down to a few thousand members.

Everyone alive today is descended from those few thousand that were able to make it through whatever killed off large numbers of people.  It's called an evolutionary bottleneck.

We're *lucky* to have advanced warning that another one is about to happen.  This gives those who *could* survive if they were in better fitness *time* to get there if they can.

I have great faith in our species, but I have no delusions that it'll all be ok, that everyone survives, and this is just a little footnote in history.

No, this is an approaching bottleneck, just like the last one that occurred.

I don't have any ""proof"" that 2025 is definitive.  But seeing *this summer* for Europe rapidly diverge from historical, I think it's here.

"What Australia *isn't* prepared for, is Winter.

We definitely do not get anywhere near as cold as other countries up North (rarely dipping below 5°C in mid-Winter in Coastal cities), but our houses and buildings are built to withstand the heat and the heat only.

So unlike say Euro countries or Canada which get way way colder, you're at least able to get some respite walking into a building. Good luck with that here, though!

Results in a huge expenditure on energy here as people crank up their heaters 24/7 during Winter.

Have heaps of people in the office from the UK and a co-worker who quit a while ago from Canada, and while they're all fine and dandy outside the office bragging about withstanding the ""cold"" outside in a t-shirt and shorts or whatever, they turn into a blubbering mess once inside for an hour.

Honestly, I don't know if a lot of rental places are built for the extreme heat either. I live in one and it's not insulated whatsoever and absorbs the outside temperature for a couple days. The temperature flip-flops often here in Sydney, so you can have a 45°C day up 'til 5PM when the temperature snaps and you'll get a thunderstorm (sometimes with crazy hail), resulting in a drop down by a whopping 20°C+ which will never permeate the walls of my shitty house until the following evening, assuming the temperature doesn't spike back up the next day.

My dad's 200 year old terrace however is definitely built for the Summer and remains cold on the ground level for most days during Summer.

"Its because Américan houses are built to poor standards making AC far more necessary. Essentially they build a box, and either stick in an AC or a heater and theyre done.

European houses are built to a much higher standard with better materials. You dont find wooden or plastic houses here. It's all brick.

So in the north they use lots of insulation to keep them warm, and in the south they use shading, light colours and window shutters to keep them cool.

But yes, most people in the south still have AC, but whether or not they use it is another story, its not really necessary most of the time. Even when it's 45° outside.

The problem comes, as now, when the hot air common in the south, gets blown up to the north. Then suddenly those houses with thick insulation to keep them warm, are suddenly doing the opposite of what you want.";0.0;es22acv;t1_es1z1u2;2019-06-26 11:20:00;-1.0

"ACs don't cost much to maintain at all, if anything. Especially if you don't use them often. I'm an HVAC tech. If you wash your condenser unit once every few months and replace or clean your filters about the same amount (depending on how much you use it) you're good to go. 

If you're in one of these places that isn't set up to have ducts run or things of that nature I'd look very seriously into getting a Mini-Split AC system. I install a bunch here in Texas and all they require is a 4"" hole bored through the wall and you're good to go. The biggest selling points on them around here is their cost, efficiency, quietness, and hassle free install. They run about 1k-3k USD (depending on size and efficiency), and with the sizes of many small European houses all you need is a small one. It's like a window unit that doesn't look ugly, doesn't cost as much to run or maintain, makes virtually zero sound, and you can put it almost anywhere.

If you live in western society like Canada or the US dont have more than 2. My idea here is that 2 kids maintains a population. 3 or more increases population, which leads to overpopulation.

If you like in western society but its very crowded like the UK or parts of Europe, then having more than 1 child is adding to the problem 

If you live in places where resources are extremely scarce or in a war torn country, then why have kids? Theres a high chance of them dying before 10 and suffering their entire lives. When i see videos of young children suffering in Syria, i do wonder why their parents decided a gruesome civil war was the time to have them.

Basically my opinions on child birth boil down to only have them when your life allows for you to raise them in a good environment. Be financially stable and have the country you live in benefit from having another member

I agree with most of what you said, but this is slightly dubious. 

So far the temperatures have remained under the 1923 record.. and the 2003 record was only 0.1C over the 1923 record. If they need AC now due to the *extremes* (not *frequency*), then they needed it back then too.

The 45C is a forecast. It hasn't actually happened yet. Don't get me wrong, it's absolute hell though.

The fact is there's other things at play, such as increased longevity of the population leading to higher proportion of those at risk, along with concrete island effect.

However people will most certainly blame all of that on global warming, and it is potentially misleading. We've reached the situation where anything weather related must be global warming related, but the fact is there are genuinely other reasons why a modern population needs AC.";0.0;es386nu;t1_es22tbd;2019-06-26 23:37:07;1.0

Of course there's a wacky element that could happen with climate change. As it stands, the UK is artificially warmed by the jet stream, which brings warm temps northward. The UK is on the same latitude as Northern Canadian regions that freeze their tits off every winter.

"This happened to me briefly a few years ago..

I used to live in Paradise California where we'd see 110 degree days majority of July. This one day I was getting a tattoo in a shop with no AC. And like 4 people in there. So artificial humidity was high plus heat. 

I was half way through my tattoo and started seeing spots and my head was spinning and I almost passed out had I not had the dude stop so I could go to the bathroom. 

I've also lived in a house for 28 years with no AC in the same city, and the same sort of high humidity because 5 of us were in there. Idk how I lived to be 37, let alone my folks who are in their 60s without someone getting heat stroke";0.0;es21way;t1_es1owrd;2019-06-26 11:15:03;2.0
I hate humidity. A lot of people complain about 38-39 degrees celscius in LA, but dry heat just makes you feel like you’re in an oven so it’s not too bad but 38-39C with humidity makes you feel like you’re being boiled alive or something. I would not recommend it. You can take multiple showers a day but right after you get out of the shower, unless you’re in front of an AC, you’ll start being sweaty again;0.0;es26qao;t1_es1owrd;2019-06-26 12:16:23;2.0

I would also add the portion how casual consumer media is unable to provide information at level of depth detailed enough to actually generate understanding of a topic of this magnitude, coupled with the built in objective of not being the one starting wide spread panic. 

&#x200B,

First leads to the fact that everything shown in casual media is - as you state - conservative timetables when level of certainty is high enough and thus watered down to when it comes to the level of detail required by the topic: We are in global crisis before 2060 yes, but 1st billion starts to migrate from uninhabitable regions pretty damn soon. 

&#x200B,

Second means that no outlet of information wants to volunteer to be the source of saying exactly what this means, how much water there actually is, how dependant each country is on each others electricity production, how fragile water-, sewage-, electricity and support networks actually are - and how incompetent and poorly funded governmental support structures actually are when compared to the magnitude of people who are going to be migrating.

Nah, it's standard fare up north, and it's something that screws up southerners when snow hits. When there's heavy snow roads are pretty barren so it's not like you need the traffic control of stoplights, if you stop at one, you won't start up again. Thus, you slow down enough to make sure someone isn't doing the same thing at the same time, and otherwise just go through all intersections.

When I say 85 I mean the actual indoor temperature, in Texas the summer temperatures outdoors are usually much hotter (ranging from mid-low 90s on a mild day to well over 100, which seems to have become more and more common. My area hit 115 last year), and even with all the non-AC mitigation possible the house would still get very uncomfortably hot. My house has two units, one for upstairs and one for down. A couple summers ago the upstairs unit died on us and that half of the house was borderline uninhabitable for a week, with temperatures staying at 85+ even at night. I think part of the issue is that buildings in the US are not exactly designed to easily block out heat because it’s not so much of a concern when it’s acceptable to just run the ac. Large windows with inadequate shades are common.

free college? how about this - you dont NEED a college education to get through life. so stop spiking demand for useless college degrees that put people through insurmountable debt while asking for loan forgiveness which penalizes people who work WITHOUT a college degree or people who got degrees in fields that are actually USEFUL.

free child care? how about a solid nuclear family instead of encouraging women to be single-mothers. how about strong moral values that tell men not to fuck around, get girls pregnant, and dip?

thats not even an issue of conservative vs liberal. its a fucking question of being decent human beings.

"Where is 'here""? The sweater part is so interesting.

I often think of my parents growing up in the semi-Irish slums of Philadelphia, crowded houses, no fans and wonder how everyone didn't kill each other because of that night heat. 

I grew up in Alabama before air conditioning. We'd sit in church with these silly little hand fans, like they did anything at all. I always laugh at Hollywood period movies that are set in pre-air conditioning Deep South and everyone's clothes are dry. No one was dry in the summer, ever. 

We drove through Mobile once (we lived in Birmingham), down by the Gulf of Mexico, and I thought this air is too thick and wet to breathe. Galveston, same.

Now imagine having to pick cotton, filled with thorns (Yeah, most people don't know that part) all day in that heat and humidity.

"Right now? Yes, they do. Just like here in the UK we needed it for about 3 weeks last year.

But again, it would be used for a month, maximum. At least 11 out of 12 months it would be sitting there, completely unused. The cost of installing and maintaining it is high (I'm going to bet it's much higher than in the US because it's so rare). It's just not worth it for something you're only going to use for 8% of the year.

However, like I said, as we start seeing the effects climate change, it will almost certainly become more popular. Heatwaves are becoming more common, and we're starting to get 30+ degrees in the summer months on a much more regular basis. So I do believe it will become more common in houses, for people who have enough disposable income to get it (which I'd bet is quite a small percentage of the population at the moment). Hopefully, as it becomes more popular, it will become more affordable and more available to the masses.

Edit: I just saw your ninja edit. The people dying are almost always vulnerable people (elderly, babies, people with underlying conditions who were already quite sick). Like I said, quite a small percentage of the population can justify the cost of installing AC, and vulnerable people tend to be poorer, and they'll probably struggle more with organising an installation. It's not like AC installers are common here, I've only ever found them by specifically Googling it, which most elderly people can't/won't do. And when you're elderly/sick, it's just much harder to get the energy and time and inclination to organise a huge installation that will disrupt your life for a few days.

"I got a portable window AC unit a few summers ago when we were having a really hot one. It cost me £400 ($500). I'm very grateful to drag it out of my attic when it gets hot and use it, it really makes a huge difference! But I'm the only person in my social circle (except perhaps my grandparents) who can afford to just casually drop £400 on something non-essential, and I'm also someone who absolutely **CAN'T STAND** being hot. I fucking hate the heat, always have, ever since I was a child. So for someone who doesn't mind the heat, who doesn't have much disposable income, the idea of dropping £400 on an air conditioning unit for the 20 days of the year it's uncomfortably hot is probably kinda ridiculous.

However, I absolutely agree with you that they will become more and more popular the crazier these summers get. It's getting to a point where we're saying there's a ""heatwave"" every year in July/August and I'm thinking ""maybe it's not a heatwave, maybe this is just what summers are now"".

You should be able to find a unit the fits inside the dimensions of the window frame, your problem will be sealing it so the cold air doesn't escape.  That will be particularly hard if your windows swing open into the room.  It's not impossible.  You could get foam to wedge between the sides,top and bottom to create a seal for the window.  I would suggest taking the window doors off it's hinges and dedicate a window for the unit during the hot months/weeks.  

This might sound a bit crazy lol, but you could build a window frame on wheels to roll your unit to the window.  That way you could seal the window frame and roll it into place, flush against the wall.   That's probably not a realistic solution.  I know they have attachments for many kinds of windows.

The single hose systems are venting hot air outside with a positive pressure.  This makes your sons room a lower pressure.  Air wants to balance so it’s going to be equalized by air from outside the room.  And eventually that air will be made up from outside air.   Hot, humid outside air is being pulled into the house at the same rate that hose is blowing out.;0.0;es29b2v;t1_es28kql;2019-06-26 12:49:54;9.0

A car thermometer is not in any way comparable to a properly calibrated weather station. When you see weather reports, forecasts, records etc, these are all based on properly calibrated and exposed thermometers in a [Stevenson screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson_screen)

Your car thermometer has got to be at least three degrees too high but probably way more than that.

Yeah it was probably bloody hot on that day, but when we take temperatures for comparison and records we need to measure them in a standard way. A car thermometer is in no way standard.

I could take a thermometer and put it my backyard on a very hot summer day and it could potentially read 60C or more, depending upon where I placed it. But that temperature would be useless for comparison because it is not standardised.

"It makes perfect sense.  0-100 F is a very natural way to think about temperature, from about as cold as you can reasonably endure without taking really serious precautions, to about as hot as you ever want to get.  

C doesn't work as well for human temperatures, because the granularity is lower, the upper part of the scale is fairly useless.  Anything above 50C, pretty much, kills people, so realistically, in hot weather, you only have about 15 degrees of precision. (30-45).   The smaller degrees in F, and the focus on human body temperature, makes it easier to remember.  50 is cold enough to want a jacket, 60 is pretty cool and sweater weather, 70-80 is comfortable, 90 is hot, 100 is a problem, 110+ is crazy hot.  

32 being freezing is a little weird, and the bottom of the scale probably could have been anchored differently.  The top end is meant to be human body temperature, but wasn't quite measured correctly, and IIUC, the lowest temp was the coldest that Fahrenheit could get heavily salted water before freezing.  It's a very human-based scale. 

0-100 to humans on the F scale is roughly comparable to 0-100C for water, from as cold as fresh water can be to as hot as fresh water can be.  Similarly, humans will die in 0F without excellent protection, they can go much colder with serious winter gear, but 0 is enough to kill us. 100F *can* kill us, but it usually takes a little more.  Still, you know that 100F is bad news, just by looking at the number.

0-infinite on Kelvin is pretty darn good for everything else, the minimum possible temperature is as good a baseline for non-biosphere atoms as anything else.";0.0;es2yqg7;t1_es2sear;2019-06-26 21:08:38;1.0

So while the rest of the world warms, the UK could be cut off from the thing that warms it and get colder before it gets warmer.

"The usual materials: Bricks and concrete. It is relatively old and thus it has no fancy new materials.

There are many advises to keep a cooler temperature inside your house, but I would say that the two main tricks to achieve this are:

If your house is colder than the outside, do not open the windows. This sounds extremely obvious, but then people open their windows at 15:00 and they wonder why it is so hot.
You should only open the windows after 19:00 and before 10:00 (ventilation, etc).

The shades of the windows facing the Sun should always be shut. If you have windows facing away from the Sun, you can open them. 


Another trick which works for me: Grow plants inside your home. They keep the humidity up and they make the air fresher. They also release oxygen, which is good even if you don't have the problem of hot summers.

Finally, you can do more fancy stuff, such as painting your house white, having a very thick stone wall etc. but that is not as important as the two first advises, in my opinion, or, to put it in a different way, you can compensate a bad building with proper techniques.

"Did you read the report? It talks about the fossil fuel producers. It means that 70% of the greenhouse emissions are created with fuel provided by those companies, not that those companies do the emissions themselves.

Even the The Guardian article mention that it is about fossil fuel producers at least once every paragraph.

So, yeah, 100 fossil fuel companies provide the fuel that generate 70% of the emissions, a lot of which goes to energy production which ends up in households.

I am not saying by any means that companies do not have a big share (and, yes, they are most likely the biggest contributors), but this puzzle is composed of many pieces and to help with climate change we need a change of life style (reduce consumption of goods will also reduce the need for industry emissions, etc). And the end of the day, companies are polluting because the consumers want what they produce, thus our habits are at the core of almost any emission.

As American households produce twice as much CO2 per year than the average EU household, and that has nothing to do with industry.

college education is fucking ridiculously expensive because of supply and demand (like i mentioned earlier) coupled with the fact that students are willling to take ridiculous loans from the Dept of edu. which then gives universities the ability to spike up education costs and then use that money to fund even MORE loans resulting in a vicious cycle.  


child care? yeah sure, if youre looking at a system like normandy. they have great child care services but they also pay a lot of tax. child care doesnt come free. is it great? sure, but again, TINSTAAFL

im not naive. you actually just have no fucking idea what youre talking about. you dont even work in the healthcare industry and deal with the bullshit of this mixed econ system. like dude, its ***fucking pissing me off*** because you for some weird reason **think** you know what youre talking about when this is literally my everyday life";0.0;es2vgpz;t1_es2uz4l;2019-06-26 19:53:22;-2.0

Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the best president this country ever had. Harry Truman and Eisenhower are 2nd and 3rd. Every president after Jimmy Carter were and are establishment war criminals that defend the rich/Wall Street and push for American interventionism. The right is the one that does the stupid name calling with Libtard and Socialist. So it’s only fair that the Left pushes back once in a while with some clever name calling 😂. But on a serious note if I were to attack Donald Trump on policy we could start with him fondling the despicable regimes Saudi Arabia and Israel at all costs and securing an arms deal with the former. Then we could see his violation of the emoluments clause (search it up, it’s pretty horrible). Obstruction of justice is another issue. The great economy that the Right parades around is not that great. There will be a recession soon even with the stock market up and unemployment being low (products of Obama fixing the economy from that dumbass Bush). And his fake populism is pretty disgusting also in how he promised the rust belt that jobs would stay in America and companies such as Carrier/GM still pulled their manufacturing elsewhere. I’m not a stupid corporate democrat Hillary lover who mindlessly screams “RUSSIA!” At every instant and tells Trump to be more PC and genteel. If the True Left and Progressives want to defeat Trump in 2020 (like Bernie), they need to attack him solidly on his disastrous policies and leave the BS name calling that Hillary did in 2016.;0.0;es2jo3d;t1_es2ixvt;2019-06-26 15:26:12;2.0
Lol don’t smoke weed but am a huge Bernie supporter (I do advocate for the legalization of all drugs/releasing non violent drug offenders from prison). But to your point about Obama (who frankly was pretty meh but Better than Trump). Obama cleaned up the economy from Bush and led us to prosperity again which trump is touting as his own accomplishment. The thing about the economy though is that a recession is due very soon. With trumps policies of deregulation within Wall Street and “creating” many new low income minimum wage jobs (that are part of his lowest unemployment ever accomplishment lol), economists are predicting a recession on the horizon. It’s people like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren who actively want to help the economy not cuntservatives like you and Trump. Also if you’re not convinced on that point let’s look to Trumps violation of the emoluments clause and His extraordinary love affairs with both  Israel and Saudi Arabia (who he gave a freaking Arms deal to). His fake populist rhetoric was also a facade as he still let companies like GM and Carrier outsource jobs to Mexico and China.

"No. [Livestock isn't. Agriculture is about 7.5% of our CO2 emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#carbon-dioxide-co2-emissions-by-sector) Agriculture does contribute a very significant amount of other gases (NH4 and N20), but all that considered its still at fucking best is 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Also note that a significant amount of N20 comes from artificial fertilizers so a non-meat diet is still fucking the world. Stop blaming people for eating. 

Start blaming the biggest polluter by a huge margin: Fossil fuels. The catch is: You would literally need to shut down the global economy to cut out the biggest polluter and that is never going to happen. Which is why people moved onto blaming the 10% instead of the 90%, but guess what, we cut out that 10% we are still stuck on a disaster course. 

Everyone underestimates how huge of a problem our greenhouse gas emissions are and how impossible the solutions are. We talk in vague terms because it's easy to say ""some kid is going to figure out how to fix it."" and sound reasonable.

"> Can’t wait for your reply as I’m on the edge of my seat with anticipation!

Sure.  

However, you might not be thrilled at the ""game rules"" of being ""picked to live.""

----

> I’m really intrigued by the scoring system. Is it arbitrary like whose line is it anyways or is there a structure ?

Well, you know, to be honest, I don't really know how it's scored.  I think there's a few things that matter...

The people who will be surviving this, ***long term,*** will probably have some essential traits.

I'm just gonna list a few of what I think matters.  But then again, I did say I didn't really know how we'll all be scored...

So the people who stand a good chance of being ""picked"" to live probably all have:

* Cardiovascular and physical fitness.  To a point that they can run well over 20 km in temperatures exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) with out a single rest.

* They can think quickly on their feet, react competently to unexpected situations and, importantly, dangers.

* They possess a wide knowledge of science, medical, engineering, and behavioral science, as they will likely have to rely on what information is stored in their head.  Ready access to information likely will not be possible.  At least when the power systems frequently fail.

* They will be willing to use violence, ***immediately***, if required.  People who hesitate to mortally or savagely wound others will likely have difficulty defending themselves.

* A natural instinct for leadership, self preservation, and the insight when to *not* be a leader to allow group cohesion.  People who can't decide what to do, or who can't handle when someone else has a better idea, probably will not survive, and probably will not be allowed to survive if they threaten others.

* Compassion and empathy for your fellow human.  While you will certainly need to be violent if the situation calls, you will also need to be willing to help, even defend others.  No human is going to survive this solo.  Teamwork is essential.

----

That's all I got for you right now.  I'm sure in time, other traits needed will become evident as the situation evolves.

> I guess it could be arbitrary to my life just like the number of Indians dying in India. 

I'm guessing this moment in time will register for you.

At this point, one of two outcomes for you is likely:

* You process this information over the course of a few days.  It begins to register as your brain reprioritizes your concerns.  It is an entirely natural and completely ok process.  Getting hit with something that brings you full stop, and alters course in how you view the world is something a lot of us will be doing over the next decade.

* You act like this is some contest you have to win.  You have to have a really good comeback because you've been ""shown up"" by this dude.  I'm not playing that game, you don't have to either.  Good luck, and remember: having people *who like you, and value you as a person* will greatly increase your chances of ""being picked"" (to survive).";0.0;es4vw3e;t1_es4dvhg;2019-06-27 10:28:05;9.0

You live in a country where houses are built  around the premise that AC will be available in some format to assist in  keeping the building cool, and you live in a country where this  enormous market need has existed since AC was invented, giving decades of investment, infrastructure and development into building a solid manufacturing and production line for AC.* 

Europe doesn't so for literally hundreds of years have designed their houses to stay warm in the winter *not* to vent heat in the summer. Yes, it's 'possible to accommodate both'. It's possible by designing and building brand new houses in an American style that *can* accommodate both.

High thermal mass reduces the temperature difference between night and day - it doesn't increase the average temperature.

Because I can tell you, proper shade management does nothing against swamp humidity. White paint does nothing against the humidity.

"Mmm, I respect your point, and agree about fossil fuels, but disagree to an extent on your viewpoint of ""blaming people for eating.""

-Up front, Ag produces more than half of global methane, based on your link.  Based on ""CO2 equivalent tons"" from the chart in your link, energy is still far and away the winner, but Ag is still pretty significant (~23 billion tons equivalent CO2 for energy, ~12 billion tons equivalent CO2 for Ag).  We're not talking 10%.  We're talking more like 30%.

-That 7.5% figure...I also wonder how inclusive it is.  I believe that your source derived that number from somewhere, but my question would be, ""What all does that entail?""  Chicken farms require massive amounts of electricity to power fans that run all day to keep birds cool.  Lights, A/C, etc for various animal housing.  Processing of dairy requires massive amounts of heat followed by refrigeration for pasteurization.  Those eat up energy, and thus result in CO2 release.  Not to mention, at the end of it all, meat and dairy MUST be refrigerated or frozen.  That'll eat energy too.  See further down for a different source.

-The above scratches the surface by looking at energy consumption only.  I'm curious if that 7.5% figure includes the fertilizer, pesticides, transport, etc, required to grow the crops, transport the food, and feed the animals?  Hunting down various sources, I'm getting figures between 25-40% of all food grown on earth (suitable for human consumption) is fed to livestock.  I'm guessing the large range boils down to what you consider ""suitable for human consumption.""  Because feeding to animals inherently creates inefficiency (given off as heat as the animal grows), it's less efficient to eat animals vs. crops directly.

-I would also ask how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere by generating farmland in the first place.  While mature temperate and tropical forests are considered ""carbon neutral"" (e.g. they don't trap more carbon than they release, because they're constantly growing/dying/decaying), they do at least HOLD a lot of carbon.  Slash and burn agriculture, or clearing woods for pastureland releases that carbon.  Moreover, trees are more effective at reflecting sunlight away from the ground.  Bare dirt (e.g. a plowed field that was used to make animal feed) is fantastic at absorbing it.  Land use absolutely contributes to climate change.

Up front, you are correct.  Fossil fuel consumption is the meanest, biggest, baddest elephant in the room.  But I also think you under-appreciate the energy used by the agriculture industry.  My hunch is that that 7.5% number accounts for CO2 given off by the animals, and doesn't include all of the other forms of energy they consume, nor the consequences of their existence.

https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/world-flowchart.jpg

That guy provides a bit more insight into it.  They've got Agriculture tabbed at 13.5%, with another 1.5% tacked onto it for energy use by the Ag sector.  ""Land use change"" is another whopping 18% in that chart.  My bet (though I cannot prove this) would be that some (though not all, by any stretch) of that land use comes from agriculture.

I'm not vegan.  I'm not even vegetarian, though I try to limit my meat consumption pretty drastically.  I'm not here to lecture you on how Ag is killing the planet.  There are bigger fish to fry, and we both know that.  I'm just trying to add perspective, and state that you're under-appreciating the role that meat production has as a part of the problem.

Feel free to discuss!  I know I'm missing the point where the other 60-75% of food that IS grown for human consumption probably contributes to greenhouse gases (likely most of the N2O production, for example), and undercuts my argument against meat somewhat.

">People who can't decide what to do, or who can't handle when someone else has a better idea, probably will not survive, and probably will not be allowed to survive if they threaten others.

Late to the game, but wanted to comment on this. 

I believe determining leadership skills is important. Most people do not handle stressful decisions well. It is critical to determine who does long before you need it. 

More important than having a strong leader is being in a group that understands what makes someone a leader you should follow.

You have an opportunity now to see how people will react. I have experienced this with others. They do not make good leaders, but think they are right so they should be *in charge.*

A good leader listens and incorporates all worthy ideas, they are able to assess the needs of the everyone. They have the ability to judge situations and accept ideas other than their own. They don’t need to have good ideas, they need to be able to make decisions, and admit when they were wrong.

Recently, I was travelling with a group of people. Two members of the group ""leading"" moved at such a pace that they became lost in crowds. The rest were unfamiliar with the area, itinerary and language.

There were plenty of places to get hung up -- where access might be denied, etc. I had asked the two leaders to slow down by 20% or to stop frequently and make sure the rest of the group made it through each checkpoint. I didnt want to call the shots, I was merely addressing a problem. You know, I wanted everyone to just pause and turn around because no one wants to be left behind. 

You're the leader and responsible for these people. It would avoid a serious problem because you would know when someone got held up rather than 20 minutes later when someone realized Conan is not on the bus and we stand around and figure out who saw him last and where. I was ignored. Repeatedly. There were times when people were literally running with heavy luggage out of fear of being separated.

Good leaders protect the interests of everyone and can adapt. When their plans are challenged, they can put their ego aside and evaluate the criticism, make the necessary corrections. They don't waste time or energy defending ""being right."" This is the number 1 problem of most failed leaders in any situation. More importantly, the group fails to understand that a good leader is not the strongest or most aggressive. They are the ones capable of watching out for everyone's needs and can **adapt** to changing situations.

I then suggested we stop and come to an agreement what to do if someone gets lost. Should they wait at the last point and the group return? Could we come to an agreement on that, since they were unwilling to slow down? I was told I was being paranoid and the next moment, we lost the last person because of a ticket problem.

Instead of simply agreeing that maybe I was right and adjusting, the group was told they need to keep up. Granted, that might be ideal in a survival situation, but this wasn't. They simply didn't want to admit they were wrong.

This became the dynamic. It created so many problems. Every time I suggested we address potential problems, I was told I was paranoid.

I always have a plan B. Like my family knows if there is an emergency and communication is down, where we will meet up. I don't spend critical time in stressful situations making a decision or weighing options. Preparation isn't about having the stuff ready, it is about having a plan.

Most people aren't going to die because they aren't strong enough. They are going to die because they don't make good decisions, and that includes who should be in charge.";0.0;f77oedf;t1_es4vw3e;2019-11-11 19:21:04;2.0

dental falls into same category as most medical services. Im not familiar with hearing. vision continues to be covered by private (which fuck me, is way more affordable than the mixed system we have)


socialist:
cover pre-existing conditions. everyone who can pay gets taxed and pays high premiums. healthcare can easily cover most conditions but with long wait times (or without being granted) for elective surgeries. research in medicine loses funding. minors and young adults can still stay on parents insurance. all medical services become controlled by government. everyone gets healthcare, its more efficient to get healthcare for simple conditions, but with long wait times for less common conditions, and less progress towards curing cancer and whatever shit is hard to cure

">-Up front, Ag produces more than half of global methane, based on your link. Based on ""CO2 equivalent tons"" from the chart in your link, energy is still far and away the winner, but Ag is still pretty significant (~23 billion tons equivalent CO2 for energy, ~12 billion tons equivalent CO2 for Ag). We're not talking 10%. We're talking more like 30%.

If energy and agriculture were the only two sources of greenhouse gases then yes it'd be 30%. The reality is there are lots of sources and it adds up to more than 35b tonnes. Energy's 23b tonnes is 45% of the total 50b tonnes of greenhouse gases. Agriculture is 5b tonnes (not 12b). 5b tonnes out of 50b... So 10%. Fossil Fuels account for 9 times the amount of emitted gases. It is almost an order of magnitude more important to address fossil fuel consumption than it is agriculture. (These are old numbers, but the percentages haven't changed much.)

You are drastically overestimating the methane issue. Methane is more potent than CO2, however it is significantly more short lived. Methane last around a decade in the atmosphere. Additionally our emission of methane is not increasing in dramatic fashion. CO2 on the other hand can last thousands of years. The methane produced in the 20th century is already gone. The CO2 produced since the industrial revolution is still kicking around in our atmosphere. This is why the heat is already baked in. We are going to heat up. There is no avoiding it at this point. It might take thirty years for the CO2 to do the damage that methane does in a year, but it is going to be there for hundreds of years. Short term methane hurts, long term CO2 kills us.

>-That 7.5% figure...I also wonder how inclusive it is. I believe that your source derived that number from somewhere, but my question would be, ""What all does that entail?"" Chicken farms require massive amounts of electricity to power fans that run all day to keep birds cool. Lights, A/C, etc for various animal housing. Processing of dairy requires massive amounts of heat followed by refrigeration for pasteurization. Those eat up energy, and thus result in CO2 release. Not to mention, at the end of it all, meat and dairy MUST be refrigerated or frozen. That'll eat energy too. See further down for a different source.

You fix energy this isn't a problem. Yes, how we use the energy generated is an important question, but people aren't going to stop using energy so it is really a red herring to the actual problem. We get our energy by burning fossil fuels and that is what needs to be addressed.

>-I would also ask how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere by generating farmland in the first place. While mature temperate and tropical forests are considered ""carbon neutral"" (e.g. they don't trap more carbon than they release, because they're constantly growing/dying/decaying), they do at least HOLD a lot of carbon. Slash and burn agriculture, or clearing woods for pastureland releases that carbon. Moreover, trees are more effective at reflecting sunlight away from the ground. Bare dirt (e.g. a plowed field that was used to make animal feed) is fantastic at absorbing it. Land use absolutely contributes to climate change.

Most estimates put farmland used for livestock at 30-40% of total farmland. So again. You don't even reduce the issue by half if everyone suddenly stopped eating meat. It isn't a realistic solution. Being generous 40% of 10%. It is 4% of our problem. We are quibbling over whether we need to change that 4% for an A instead of an A- here. That is luxury we don't get when we aren't going to pass the class at all.";0.0;es3651y;t1_es32kbt;2019-06-26 23:10:10;1.0

\- Assuming I run it for an average of 3-4 hours a day, that is about 1.50GBP a day, or about 10.50GBP a week.

\- If it is only particularly bad for, say, a month (and the rest of the time the AC shouldnt be necessary, just use fans etc), we are looking at roughly 50GBP to 'survive' the summer in running costs.

here in sweden they don't even sell window ac units at all only portable units or permanent two part ones for houses. and they are not cheap, this year a bought a 11000 BTU portable unit for around 4000kr (~440 USD) on sale, and i can't find any units for under ~260 usd for the smallest ones;0.0;es1ymtf;t1_es1w12l;2019-06-26 10:34:20;5.0

I moved to the Netherlands around 6 years ago, and minus last year, summers aren’t bad. At least here, the temperature in summer is low to mid 20’s. You’d get the occasional wave for a few days, where it can hit early 30’s, but it would always rain after 3 or 4 days and cool the weather down. It’s only since last summer that AC looked like a necessary option for your house. Most houses, especially newer ones, are insulated pretty well, because they have to keep out of the cold in winter. The problem with summer is that it gets stuffy inside, so you open your windows, but that’s useless when outside is warmer than inside, as it heats up your house instead of cooling it. But that’s the reason why AC isn’t so common here, there isn’t much need for it. During the day you have your shades drawn to keep the sun out, and at night it’s fairly cool.;0.0;es2mrfo;t1_es28rxx;2019-06-26 16:23:59;3.0

Yes, high thermal mass buildings don't reach thermal equilibrium because the day-night cycle happens too fast. This is not a problem.

On your first point, I'm getting 12b tons from the combination of CO2/N2O/CH4.  The link you provided lists ""CO2 equivalents"" in the subsequent charts for N2O and CH4.  Ag is really bad for N2O, and energy/ag are similar for total CH4.  So that's how I'm coming up with the 12b mark, similar to how I came up with 23b tons CO2 equivalent for energy (20b tons of CO2, 3b tons CO2 equivalent in CH4).  Less of a ""you're wrong"" and more of a ""this is how I got that number.""

>you fix energy this isn't a problem

Good point, but that takes time.  It will take years, probably decades, to shift totally away from fossil fuels entirely.  Does it need to happen?  Yes, of course, and as soon as freaking possible, ideally.  But it takes time to build wind/solar farms, nuclear plants, and hydro.  It takes time to build the infrastructure to store energy and distribute it during non-peak renewable times of day.  You can stop eating meat (or eat less of it) today.  It's less impactful overall, but you can literally make that change today, and it will help.

To reiterate, I'm not arguing over what is more impactful.  Getting away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible is absolutely the single best thing we as a species can do.  But until our leaders get their heads out of their butts (it took me a few tries to type this without profanity), a multi-pronged, grassroots movement is literally the only non-violent, viable solution we've got.  Eating less meat is part of that approach.  Underselling solutions that can help, even minutely, is disingenuous to your cause, IMO.";0.0;es39ou0;t1_es3651y;2019-06-26 23:55:48;1.0
"You know what was the most depressing? The rest of the group was complaining privately but did not speak up or attacking me when I did. This is what will happen in a survival situation.

I was an asshole for suggesting these two slow down. And one of the people pissed at me was the person who had been left behind. Thank Dog there was a delay. So I asked, ""What should we do in this situation? Assume everyone went on ahead, or should we stop and wait for the group to find us?"" I seriously wanted a plan. ""You should keep up. We travel frequently and this is our pace."" I knew then that there was zero accommodation for anyone else's needs or limitations. 

This will happen 10x worse in collapse.

And that's the difference. I want to know what I am supposed to do so I don't have to guess what is the correct decision. I was concerned about the rest of the group.

After 14 hours of this, no meals and one 15 minute break for coffee, I finally lost it. You know, the point about being better physically fit is duly noted. I should be and will start today because I should be able to walk briskly for 14 hours with a pack. But it kicked my ass with no rests and no food and sleep deprived. This is also poor leadership because you shouldn't move at that pace if you don’t have to because tomorrow you might.

I told them I simply could not keep up that pace and I would be skipping the next day's activities so as to not slow down the group. They thought I was being shitty.

I said the risk of being lost in a foreign country with no cell phone service, where I did not speak the language with $100 in currency I didn't know was too great for me. The anxiety was torture. I told them the few times I lost sight of them filled me with panic because I did not know if they would stop and look for me or just get on a bus and leave.

You know what their solution was? ""You should have told us we were walking too fast."" WTF? ""I did, multiple times."" The ones who had heard me sheepishly looked away and didn't speak up. They had asked, too, but we're too chickenshit to say anything.

At one point, I said something about a sign to Oak Groves Gardens ""back there."" One group member argued there was no such place as Oak Groves Gardens, they had never heard of such a place and I was wrong because they were an expert and obviously I am an idiot. This went on for ten minutes until I demanded we go back to the sign. ""Well, of course i have heard of the Gardens at Oak Groves before, no one refers to it as the Oak Groves Gardens"" that was on the fucking sign. Seriously. Like it was always about them being *right* rather than making *decisions based on accurate information.*

At one point, they told us we were on a bus for three more stops. I pointed to the display and said our stop was next. The ""leader"" argued with me that it was three stops but the bus didn't actually stop because it was an express. Our group was scattered. I was worried they wouldn't know to get off when the bus stopped and we had bags and the doors were automated. They might wait for 3.  He got angry with me, asked the group if they understood and all of them agreed with me, they thought it was the third time the bus stopped. He then said he didn't care and I was being pedantic. Understand no one spoke the language or knew where we were going so this was kind of important. ""I know where we are going"" is all that mattered.

I came away with a new understanding of the world and my own rules. I tested it out on the ride home. First thing I said was, ""I know this is going to not make sense, but I need you to go this route. Can you do that?"" Driver said yes. So I reiterated I was tired, stressed and I didn't want an argument. ""Are you sure you're not going to have a problem doing it this way?"" Assures me it will be okay. Goes the wrong way and gets lost. I get pissed and say, ""Look, this is what I was trying to avoid. Can you go the way I want or not?"" Assures me yes. I watch, point out they need to get over in the other lane, they argue with me the way they are going is fine. And we are on the wrong freeway. I demand they pull over and I will drive. 

I am the asshole because I made him feel bad. I don't care. I no longer give a shit about people's feelings in these situations because they are not going to back me up anyway. 

The vast majority of people are going to die because they will not demand better leaders. They will not call out leaders for being wrong and they will attack the ones who do. 

You don't want to have a plan? Good luck, but you're not on my team. You think reducing risk is stupid? You're not on my team. You need to argue that you're right? You're not on my team.

Your run-on sentences are annoying to read by the way. I just want to make that clear, since you *are* the one calling me ""retarded"" and ""dumb"".

Yeah, speaking from experience.  Was highly athletic when I was 20.  Biked 20 miles daily.  140 miles a week.  Was in not so terrible shape.

> This is also poor leadership because you shouldn't move at that pace if you don’t have to because tomorrow you might.

Exactly.  Kinda unrelated, also you should always carry the maximum amount of water you can on you when traveling away from a clean source of water.

> I said the risk of being lost in a foreign country with no cell phone service, where I did not speak the language with $100 in currency I didn't know was too great for me. The anxiety was torture. I told them the few times I lost sight of them filled me with panic because I did not know if they would stop and look for me or just get on a bus and leave.

They don't like hearing this because there is a secondary conclusion that the brain will automatically form.  **Your** concerns are *normative* (i.e. reasonable and common to the group) therefore it must be *their leadership skills* are divergent.  Specifically, they are *inadequate* and that implication invokes anger on your part, and shame (self divergence) on theirs.

> You know what their solution was? ""You should have told us we were walking too fast."" WTF? ""I did, multiple times.""

To deflect the shame, this is an attempt to re-normalize their behavior.  ""I was being reasonable, you should have done so and so"".  Oh I would be pissed at this point.  Actually I would be furious at this point.  I would need a time out.

> The ones who had heard me sheepishly looked away and didn't speak up.

Ugh.  Well, they probably all had anxiety and that does wonders to sabotage your confidence to intervene.  I am a bit of an expert on feeling anxious involuntarily at times, lol.

> This went on for ten minutes until I demanded we go back to the sign. ""Well, of course i have heard of the Gardens at Oak Groves before, no one refers to it as the Oak Groves Gardens"" that was on the fucking sign. Seriously. Like it was always about them being right rather than making decisions based on accurate information.

You know some people get sabotaged very early on by their parents and upbringing.  They teach them that it's important to save face.  And this is very, very damaging because making mistakes is how the brain learns.  Feeling like it's **not ok to make (harmless) mistakes** is a massive handicap to being well informed, practiced, experienced, and able to learn how to improve (in front of others).  I can almost guarantee you that those guides were either raised that way, or spend time around others who value saving face, and that's why it's important to them.  Unfortunately, it makes them shit leaders as well.

> At one point, they told us we were on a bus for three more stops. I pointed to the display and said our stop was next.

You know at this point I bet they almost felt like you were arguing just to argue.  Which probably then made them place even less significance on what you were saying.  ""Oh this person is always squabbling with me, I'm just going to ignore them"".  They obviously felt like they knew what was up and why should they risk messing up their perfect plan by listening to someone with a different idea.

> I am the asshole because I made him feel bad.

OK one more, damit.  Very much anger and shame are divergence in action.  It is so goddamn helpful to recognize that.  Once you know **why** we have these reactions in the first place, it becomes possible to recognize that you can just simply let the emotion pass.  You don't need to dwell on it.  You don't need to rectify it.  But you have to first understand what anger (and it's spectrum from annoying to rage) and shame (embarrassment to mortified) really are.  Handy, handy, handy to know.  In the world currently, people will feel anger and shame and then feel like they must rectify it somehow, which causes problems sometimes.

> I don't care. I no longer give a shit about people's feelings in these situations because they are not going to back me up anyway.

Another option is, if you can somehow convince them that it will be ok for them to make a mistake, the will not feel so upset about it when they do.

----

> The vast majority of people are going to die because they will not demand better leaders. They will not call out leaders for being wrong and they will attack the ones who do.

Oh dear god yes.  And you're right about attacked.  See, what happens if people learn a pattern of behavior that is not long term survivable&nbsp,?  They can wipe themselves out due to **sticking to their old behavior.**  They will even resist attempts to alter that behavior.  This is exactly what is happening when you hear about advocates for changing customs getting lynched or attacked (like ending blasphemy laws in countries that are insanely religious).  They are attacking divergent behavior that is outside of the expected behavior of the group.  And it's a damn shame that it keeps happening worldwide.  You are very correct in suspecting that those who try to change things will draw fire.  Especially from the more emotional ones.

> You don't want to have a plan? Good luck, but you're not on my team. You think reducing risk is stupid? You're not on my team. You need to argue that you're right? You're not on my team.

Yeah sometimes I don't have a plan, but I definitely feel that being in a group where others can help pick up your weaknesses is the way to go.  On my own, a single failure may take me out.

"A HUGE part of this is livestock. The Native Americans didn't have many of the same livestock that Europeans LIVED AND SLEPT WITH. 

It's 3AM so I'm not gonna cite this properly, but from ORIGINS OF MAJOR HUMAN INFECTIOUS DISEASES:

""More temperate diseases arose in the Old World than New World because far more animals that could furnish ancestral pathogens were domesticated in the Old World. Of the world's 14 major species of domestic mammalian livestock, 13, including the five most abundant species with which we come into closest contact (cow, sheep, goat, pig and horse), originated in the Old World (Diamond, 1997). The sole livestock species domesticated in the New World was the llama, but it is not known to have infected us with any pathogens (Diamond, 1997, Dobson, 1996)—perhaps because its traditional geographic range was confined to the Andes, it was not milked or ridden or hitched to ploughs, and it was not cuddled or kept indoors (as are some calves, lambs and piglets). Among the reasons why far more tropical diseases (nine versus one) arose in the Old World than the New World are that the genetic distance between humans and New World monkeys is almost double that between humans and Old World monkeys, and is many times that between humans and Old World apes, and that much more evolutionary time was available for transfers from animals to humans in the Old World (about 5 million years) than in the New World (about 14,000 years).""";0.0;es2pwx3;t1_es2erok;2019-06-26 17:30:31;3.0

- fridge active 8 hours a day every day = 438KwH/year
- TV on at least 4 hours a day = 189KwH/year
- 800W bedroom AC, on 6 hours a day ~20 days a year = 96KwH/year

If your everyday moron, and there are so, so, so many of them, can elect other morons running on moronic, self-destructive platforms, then accomplishing goals legislatively is boned.  As long as republicans hold the senate here in the U.S., and they may for several years more (2020 is a long shot...possible, but difficult), nothing even remotely progressive on climate change happens.  Grassroots awareness to the problem is the only thing that will help.  Convince the idiot farmers that as climate change worsens, there won't be a guarantee that their family's land will be arable.   Convince the idiot racists that large-scale climate change will cause more mass migration, increasing the likelihood that we have to house more immigrants whether they like it or not.  Convince the idiot religious folks (non-doomsday, non-dominionists...their idiocy knows no bounds) that they're supposed to be stewards of the rock their God put them on, not rapists of it.  Convince the idiot Mormons that they have a math problem...you can't have 5-10 kids every generation, or eventually you run out of resources and their kids' kids will literally f-ing starve because of their selfishness.  Convince poor idiots that eating beans and grains is ultimately cheaper than meat, and can be delicious when prepared well.  Convince any and every idiot willing to listen that climate change is important.  To me, I need to get everyone on board and raise awareness.  Whether I can convince them to recycle, eat less meat, carpool, support solar/wind development, etc....my point is...I want them thinking about it.  I want to get the ball rolling on, ""Hey, this is important, we should support it.""  Then, and only then, can you have a large-scale, meaningful political movement strong enough to accomplish what we need.

While I work on convincing idiots, I'm eating less meat.  I carpool.  I recycle.  I don't have kids.  Lead by example, no?  A poll was recently taken here in the states.  70% of folks want action on climate change.  Only 34% said they'd be willing to shell out a $100/year tax to fix it.  That number needs to be higher before substantial political change can take place.

Also, no worries about harshness.  I have my days.  My office-mate is Mormon with 7 kids.  I know all about being impassioned in these types of discussions.  I think he's an idiot, despite having a PhD.  I've spent the last year and a half wearing down his conservatism bit by bit.  He even voted for the democratic candidate for governor last election!  That being said, I definitely get harsh with him when he's being a moron, so I get it.";0.0;es606ha;t1_es4vcn7;2019-06-27 21:50:06;1.0

"You know, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the links. You helped me more than you will ever realize. I have been struggling to understand this dynamic for two weeks. I felt like this was a very important lesson I needed to synthesize for survival.

I may have arrived at a different conclusion than you. I believe most people are probably liabilities in survival situations unless they have a useful skill. Most people simply can't overcome their programming that if someone isn't agreeable they aren't effective.  [See this article.](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-best-employees-are-not-the-agreeable-ones-according-to-adam-grant?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

Side note about divergent behavior. If you practice it, you tend to be more creative and find better and new solutions to problems. It also boosts dopamine which makes you tend to see out novel solutions. In other words, people who go along to get along tend to keep doing that and engage in passive behaviors and activities -- television watching, etc. They also die younger.

This was a HUGE issue for me on this trip. It wasn't about the bullshit, but trying to understand **why** this was happening to me. 

At one point, we had printed instructions for something and the group was doing something wrong. It was a minor thing, and I said, ""It says right here we should do X."" They asked, ""Well, what about Y?"" I read the one-sentence instruction and told them it didn't address Y, we should do X. One person (the sign doubter), ripped the card out of my hand and said, ""Let me see that."" He read it and said, ""It doesn't say anything about Y."" This occurred over and over again. They simply didn't believe.

I noticed people were hostile toward me for even small things like ""you dropped your ticket.""

So I was using the instruction example for the person I confided in, along with the sign incident. They saw what had happened from my perspective and literally started crying for not standing up for what was right -- and allowing others to treat me like shit when I was trying to protect the group. 

It was at this point when I realized people will sacrifice others to save their own ass -- or even save face, despite knowing something is wrong. Most people are horribly selfish and frankly pretty stupid. 

I expressed that I felt I had to sacrifice what I wanted, or what was safe or right, in order to appease the group and I wasn't going to do this. So I asked this person if they would participate in my instructions to the driver, to back me up that they needed to follow my route. The same fucking thing happened, they sat there quiet, then later came and told me, ""I wanted you to know you were right, I just didn't say anything at the time. I DID hear you ask them multiple time to follow your instructions and they blew you off and then got defensive about going the wrong way."" Their reasoning? The driver felt bad and I had made them feel bad by insisting they do what I asked, what was right. I should have sat there in crippling anxiety with my mouth shut so they could ""feel good."" Being wrong, getting lost, pissing me off was preferable to making them feel bad about not being able to follow through on a promise.

>Another option is, if you can somehow convince them that it will be ok for them to make a mistake, the will not feel so upset about it when they do.

Asides from avoiding drawing hostility onto yourself, I agree, understanding the theory is a massive boost to removing invisible chains around your thinking.  Because then it makes sense why things:

* are taboo/prohibited **now** (We can't do this.  It can't be done.  Fixing global warming is too expensive.  We can't end the use of money.)
* were taboo in the past, but no longer (like a black man dating a white woman)
* and the process of how they form, and how they are dissolved (people come to understand it's not a threat, and relax about it).
 
> This was a HUGE issue for me on this trip. It wasn't about the bullshit, but trying to understand why this was happening to me.

Yeah, they need to start requiring like a whole year of study on behavioral dynamics in school.  People leave the school system and enter in the workforce in adulthood with absolutely nothing to equip them to deal with spotting depression in someone, or anxiety, or psychosis.

We need to give people in school a user's guide to the human brain.  We need to prioritize understanding just how we work.

Because the average person has about as much educaiton in neuroscience as the average person in the dark ages.  Or that is to say, we are living in a modern day dark age when it comes to people's understanding of their own brains.

> One person (the sign doubter), ripped the card out of my hand

Probably the fact that they were so often wrong, made them come to be frustrated everytime you corrected them.  Like Pavlov's dogs, they were conditioned by it.

> I noticed people were hostile toward me for even small things like ""you dropped your ticket.""

The more stressed people get, the quicker they are to anger.  See the modern part of the brain (the front part) actually is constantly spending energy to suppress the more primitive emotional brain (the lizard one).  The more primitive emotional brain is reacting with **primitive emotions** all the time and is sending those signals to the modern brain.  This is all over simplified... but if the modern brain gets overworked, then it starts losing the balance and the emotional one begins to get stronger.  And it's the one that handles aggression.

You were definately around people who were mentally taxed.

> They saw what had happened from my perspective and literally started crying for not standing up for what was right

Were they so distracted at first they didn't notice the same things you did, and therefore didn't know you were right ?  Is that why they didn't help at first ?

> It was at this point when I realized people will sacrifice others to save their own ass

Some will.

> or even save face, despite knowing something is wrong.

Yep, it's such a damaging behavior to have learned while growing up.  It just handicaps the fuck out of their ability to adapt.

> Most people are horribly selfish and frankly pretty stupid.

I am going to say, the reason for this, is that the world is very broken.  And dysfunction is everywhere.  And in a global system of having to climb on top of other people to get a good job or just an ok one, and having intellectual noise coming from every which way, they learn to be selfish, or are forced to be just to keep from being walked all over.  But I will say, if you change the conditions, you change the behaviors.  And most people do not know this about humans.

> Being wrong, getting lost, pissing me off was preferable to making them feel bad about not being able to follow through on a promise.

People will do all kinds of shit to avoid that negative self-divergent response.  I'm serious.  I mean, the purpose of it is to keep you in line with the others in an evolutionary setting.  It's powerful.  It's a very powerful feedback.  Cuz in all the humans that this wasn't very powerful, were weeded out over evolutionary time.

> I think people are too fucked up, too stuck in their patterns, too invested in being right.

They are now, but having the world fall apart and dangers rise will make them reprioritize what is important.  And hopefully saving face will not be so damn important.

Also anxiety.  People do not like to admit they were wrong if they are already feeling anxiety, since it makes them feel **more** anxiety.

"I think you should formally write a book. This could change lives.

You have multiple self-help topics you could do to make money using your approach to many problems. You could flesh out the basics, then include chapters on individual situations to make each book. Like, ""Why You Are the Family Scapegoat and What to do About it."" Or, ""Why Your Great Ideas Get You into Trouble and the Myth of the Workplace."" 

If you are interested, I know a little about traditional and self publishing as I am a ghostwriter. I can help if you need it. (You may have been published in journals already -- I don't know. I am not making any judgment about your writing just throwing this out there because you have been so generous with sharing your own knowledge.)

I am writing a book a loosely related topic and some of what I have learned on this trip will be included. 

I feel I have a good layman's understanding of brain science due to my own struggles. My best friend was writing a text book in neuropsychology and taught me tons. I have done hundreds of hours of quantitative EEG testing for her, as well as neurofeedback. Fun Fact, she traced my narcolepsy to a tiny portion about the size of a pencil eraser of my brain in the cingulate. She also said it was likely the reason for my ""weird personality"", but frankly, your explanation does more for me than any therapy or brain testing ever did. You kind of gave me a big piece of the puzzle I was missing.

For years, I have wondered why people are so threatened by me. For example, in a leadership conference recently with 150 people, i sat in the back and did not utter one word. I just listened for three days. Many people participated, others did not. I thought I could avoid being a target by hiding. 

At the end, we had to stand and say something to the group. I purposely picked something short and agreeable. The leader pulled me aside a jumped my shit asking me what was my deal. So I asked what did I do wrong? I literally did not say a word. She said that she could tell I was really smart, could have contributed to the program but I didn’t. ""You hid in the back to avoid dealing with your problem and THAT is your problem.""

I have always made an effort to hide my intellect because I thought all this hostility was because I was smart. I then thought it might be misogyny because I am a woman. I thought it might have been because I question all forms of authority.  I struggled with this for years -- my whole life for that matter.

This may be too much information, but I grew up in a narcissistic family dynamic. From the age of four, I always got this weird vibe from my mother that she didn't like me. I could never understand why. Like I remember arguing with my sister about airplanes. I said that every day, an airplane flies overhead. She said it wasnt true. My mother sided with my sister and I knew she was lying. I could tell from her demeanor, plus I had seen multiple airplanes every day. 

As I got older, I realized she resented me. I thought it was because I was smart.  My father was a certified genius so I thought she felt threatened. She is very much about smoothing things over and getting along. She would always make stupud comments like telling me to pretend I didn't know about my boyfriend cheating so he didn't dump me. I am estranged from my most of my family because of their constant barrage of pressure to ""get in line"" and conform. My sister would call me drunk and spend an hour telling me why I was fucked up, how I should stop demanding my mother quit lying about me, how I should forgive my sister for swindling me out of tens of thousands, and that my ""socialist political views"" were going to make me unemployable. FYI, I ghostwrite for Democrats.

My divergent thinking has cost me so much in life. I have always been baffled as to what the problem was. I was polite, helpful, kind, attractive, but there was always this strong hostility towards me. This really makes sense.

I need to focus on a solution. It is nice to know it isn't me, it is their reaction to my divergent thinking.

My suggestion to you if you write about this would be to dumb it way down. The way you can do this is by explaining it multiple ways. One might be to outline a situation as an example, then use a scholarly one with links, and finally, a short summary. This gives people three ways to understand it, but also an opportunity to refine the concept. Most important is that a longer explanation gives them time to process it.

Like, you don't have to rip the entire house down to get some form of A/C (I have zero idea why you Euros, who know *nothing* about HVAC, think the installation of it in a house means you tear the building apart). There are people living in basically hovels in the US who can afford a window unit A/C that gets them through our brutal summers.

And a lot of American usage is less about ""expect"" and more about ""need"". People couldn't live in a reasonable fashion in a whole bunch of places in this country without A/C, it would be a hellscape in the summer in a lot of states without it. Like, Phoenix AZ has 1.6 million people living in it because A/C is a thing, if A/C didn't exist Phoenix wouldn't have disappeared but most of those 1.6 million people would have. If we didn't have A/C we'd be a top-heavy country in population because some states flat out suck to live in for a lot of the year.

Thanks.  I fully expect no good deed to go unpunished and this to come back to bite me down the road.  I just know it, lol.

> I thought I could avoid being a target by hiding.

That innate sense to conform goes back to evolution.  And when people get stressed, their response to nonconformity gets stronger.

> ""You hid in the back to avoid dealing with your problem and THAT is your problem.""

It sounds like they may have been through your problem before as well, and could spot it in others.  Might even be why they teach the class, as they had to fix themselves first.

> I have always made an effort to hide my intellect because I thought all this hostility was because I was smart. I then thought it might be misogyny because I am a woman. I thought it might have been because I question all forms of authority.

Depending on **whom** you're dealing with, it could easily be all 3.  And then a whole lot more.  The brain is capable of making arbitrary A causes B connections.  If you talk to someone who grew up in a culture that **outright tells women** they are not smart enough to be schooled, then their brains begin to form cause and effect explanations founded on this.  So when a woman tries to correct a man in those cultures, the man may think well the woman is saying all of this because women are not smart and they are easily confused.  And so they learn to dismiss a woman because obviously they are a man and twice as smart.  Cause and effect, and also, **[obviates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obviate)** conclusions that would otherwise imply that women are just as smart.  Women **can't** be as smart, so it must be something else.

And then there's second order effects, like if you don't give someone an education, then yeah, they won't be as smart, because intelligence comes from making connections.

So it reinforces the conclusion that women are not as smart.  It's one of those self sustaining cycles once it gets underway.  A positive feedback system.  One of many clusterfucks the human race has going on right now.

And if a women questions a man, then ""she is getting out of line"" and that makes the man irritable.  AKA, a mildly, minimally hostile divergence response.  Remember, anger is simply a strong response.  As in a spectrum, from annoyance to frustration to mad to rage.  Spectrum response.  Same with shame & embarrassment, they are the same thing but softer and stronger.

Yeah divergence theory is also very much governing how people react to your conclusions you form.  As that is yet another aspect of behavior in general.  Whoo&nbsp,!  Fun times.  It's not just actions, it's also thoughts.  Or thoughts that are communicated, at least.

> My mother sided with my sister and I knew she was lying.

Yeah, that will leave some trauma in the children on the receiving end of that kind of behavior.  Sorry it happened to you.

> She would always make stupud comments like telling me to pretend I didn't know about my boyfriend cheating so he didn't dump me.

It sounds like she may have been more damaged than you realize.  Like, she feels she is unable to get an independent income on her own and feels dependent on a man for survival, and therefore will tolerate any kind of abuse.  That probably happened to your mother at some point in her younger years and why she insists on you doing it.  All of this, subconsciously without her even realizing it.  She may have even been told she **had** to have a man because she was a woman.

> I am estranged from my most of my family because of their constant barrage of pressure to ""get in line"" and conform.

This is a pattern that goes far beyond just you.  Minorities get this all the damn time.  I am sorry it happened to you.

> My sister would call me drunk and spend an hour telling me why I was fucked up, how I should stop demanding my mother quit lying about me, how I should forgive my sister for swindling me out of tens of thousands

That is a parade of red flags.  Your family is dysfunctional as hell.  And it's a chaotic echo chamber that reinforces the dysfunction.  I would stay away from that, or at least not change yourself to conform to very abberant behavior.  Btw, that is not an insult to your family.  That's a lot of people's families in what I consider to be a modern day worldwide dark age.

> and that my ""socialist political views"" were going to make me unemployable.

Hahahaha.  [Then you will love this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cwhz32/fracking_in_us_and_canada_linked_to_worldwide/eyc3gdv/)  My coworkers know me well enough and have to come to understand that I sometimes will say crazy things.  Actually, it's crazy to them, and makes sense to me, lol.

> My divergent thinking has cost me so much in life.

It's costing our species dearly.  Culture clash, wars of religion.  Fights over economic systems.  The fight for civil rights.  The fight to end slavery.  It's like humanity has an autoimmune disorder and is attacking itself.  Now, it makes sense as to why.  All of these are people trying to break out of the normal paradigm of the time and **diverge** to a different pattern of behavior.  And they are attacked for it every time.  It's the **[part 2 mechanism](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c6h1jm/hundreds_of_french_nudists_are_threatening_to/f788y5v/?context=2)** that is so **vital to understand**, as it's the mechanism that **suppresses the anger response.**  Like holy shit, there's a way to **turn it off&nbsp,?!**  Yes there is.

> I was polite, helpful, kind, attractive, but there was always this strong hostility towards me. This really makes sense.

Ahh yes, a strong and pretty woman who's independently minded and doesn't agree with you.  Highly out of the norm.  We all know good looks means a lack of strong mind.  That's ""common sense"".

 : )
 
Or as my coworker would say after I've said something dumb, ""FourChannel, you're pretty"".

> My suggestion to you if you write about this would be to dumb it way down.

Unfortunately there is a lower limit.  In order to communicate the idea and **why** it works, you have to communicate enough complexity for another person to reassemble it back together **correctly,** otherwise they will have a malformed cause and effect, and look at the world and say this isn't what's actually happening, and this **idea is wrong.**

But you can give it in smaller chunks like you say that gives people time to process it, and you're right.

This is a paradigm shift.  That means whole foundations of thought are upended and rebuilt on top of this new paradigm **from the ground up.**  Like the entire concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, sin and morals can be viewed as things that make people upset, must be **sins.**  That is not an endorsement of open season btw.  I still value not causing people harm, as any well rounded person should.

But back to the paradigm shift.  All of those neurons that need relinking in the brain, **cost real energy to change** and some people do not have enough available brain **power** to make the switch over.  And when I say brain power, I mean, literal chemical energy.  The conservation of energy is a real constraint.  Being given adderall in college helped me cover much greater distances with my brain than I otherwise would have been able to.

You are the first person who I think has actually been able to make the switch over to this new paradigm, gauging by your incorporating this idea into new cause and effect **why** things are happening.

Well holy shit, it's working.

"Well, before you start giving me gold stars, realize this has been the dynamic in my life since I was a *toddler*. 

I seemed to have the uncanny ability to piss off people, especially in positions of authority. I have spent my life trying to understand this. By the very nature of the problem, asking people about it is met with denial that it occurs, or that you're not pleasing in some way.  

In one job, a coworker pointed out to the boss that i was by far the most competent and conscientious employee so they could not understand why I was exclusively targeted for public dressing down. They said they were baffled that often I was blamed for problems that were clearly someone else's fault. It didn't stop it.

Many, many hours of introspection and discussion with trusted friends had me cycle through countless reasons that were all rejected. I was absolutely clueless.

Friends would tell me it was because I was smart + female + strong personality and trying to conceal that made the problem worse when people realized I was not being genuine.

My stints at therapy had PhDs scratching their heads as even my personality tests were odd. It seems I make decisions with great confidence, but heavily analyze my choices later. Often, I would describe the issue as I have done here and my analysis was instantly discounted as me being delusional, misreading people""s reactions, or being out of line. However, they could never give me concrete reasons why this was.

I have started this new approach to try to be more like the crowd especially in high stress situations such as department meetings. ""Oh, yes, I think a cookie decorating contest would be great for the holidays."" (and I will just shut up about the diabetics and how we should be volunteering at a soup kitchen.) It has helped. I can see this dynamic as a sort of no-win situation, so I don't get too invested in solving problems, even though I could. Just understanding why it goes sideways has allowed me to avoid some bad situations. I instantly retreat from situations where people are angry now.

"Houses and buildings in France are built with thick brick/stone/mortar walls, and older houses can have walls a foot-thick, sometimes more. Opening an exterior wall to shove an AC unit is not trivial. It's out of question in most apartment buildings in cities too.

And again - you don't find window AC units on pallets like we do here in the U.S. Chicken and egg problem, I suppose.

"If you don't consider 50k people a ""successful settlement"" then most places in the world just aren't going to meet your arbitrary criteria. 

Especially when the definition is ""a place, typically one that has hitherto been uninhabited, where people establish a community.""

No mincing words there.. literally just using them as defined. You're the one spitting hyperbole in an attempt to feel smart about your point when you were initially incorrect.

You can feel however you want, the fact is the southwest was settled long before AC was a thing. Your mincing of what makes a settlement ""successful"" is moot, whether it's 100k, 200k, 500k, 1mil, 10mil, 15mil. 

Doesn't change the fact it was settled before AC.";0.0;es3r98d;t1_es3jsfs;2019-06-27 03:08:47;1.0

"> Well, before you start giving me gold stars, realize this has been the dynamic in my life since I was a toddler.

Years ago, I imagined that divergence theory would spread like fractures in glass.  The path taken is that of least resistance.

People who are very far from understanding it (in terms of chemical energy costs to relinking huge amounts of neurons) would understandably not be able to form the resonance pattern in their heads and their brains would reject it as **no, I just don't see it that way.**  Literally, the (in)coherence pattern is too conflicting and too expensive in terms of neurons to form in their brains.  Some people will not be able to see the world through this new lens.  Especially if they have a lifetime of cause and effect links that disagree with what you're trying to show them.  Remember, cause and effect can be **anything** according to the brain.  This is why the scientific method is so valuable.  It shows us when we have cause and effect wrong.

It's the people who were already close to understanding the larger idea, or had maybe pieces figured out, but not the larger pattern.  To render this concept in your head took **less energy** than it does for most people, and it's why after spending a life time trying to analyze this problem, since you've been paying attention to the same things, your brain is tuned **closely enough for you to make the jump.**

The first people this will spread to, will be those already focused on the same problem, because of the amount of effort required for them to assimilate it into their thinking will be less than the general public, and they won't have to exert as much effort to pick it up.

The **path** of **least resistance.**

I've told this idea to many people, but you're the first to tell it back to me in your own words and **integrate it.**

So yes, you do get a gold star.  Divergence theory has now successfully made the jump from zero people, to one, and now to two.

And if it makes so much more sense now by looking at it this way, it tells me I am on the right track.  This **goes somewhere.**

I also added [Part 1A](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c6h1jm/hundreds_of_french_nudists_are_threatening_to/f7ohzei/) to the bottom of the thread.  It's the second factor involved.  Not only is the behavior itself a factor, but for the situation it's in, **how important** is it to act a certain way...

> In one job, a coworker pointed out to the boss that i was by far the most competent and conscientious employee so they could not understand why I was exclusively targeted for public dressing down.

Part 2.  The understanding why and the suppression of anger.  That coworker has come up with their own reasons why you do what you do (cause and effect), and they (in their head) do not **future predict** danger.  It's the part 2 mechanism that is why they are ok, and others ~~don't~~ aren't.  I bet if you were to ask the nice coworkers versus the hostile coworkers ""why do you do what you do"" the nice ones would give reasons that are **normative** (meaning acceptable, common to the group) and the hostile ones would give reasons (if at all) that are **divergent** (you do this because you're an evil person or whatever).  Meaning unacceptable, and ""should not be doing"".

There is totally a pattern to this.

----

> They said they were baffled that often I was blamed for problems that were clearly someone else's fault. It didn't stop it.

Oh here's a mindfuck.  **Fault & Blame.**

This follows divergence theory as well.  We assign fault and blame, based on who did something **they should not have done (divergent behavior of an individual).**  Nearly the entire framework of legal responsibility rests on this **implied concept.**  But that is totally the pattern.  If your actions were normative, if you were doing what you were supposed to be doing, you are not at fault...  But if you did something you were not supposed to do... it's your fault, unless somebody diverged even more than you.

> My stints at therapy had PhDs scratching their heads as even my personality tests were odd.

I missed that day in engineering class when they were testing us for our personality types.  Whoops.  Oh well.

> Often, I would describe the issue as I have done here and my analysis was instantly discounted as me being delusional, misreading people""s reactions, or being out of line. However, they could never give me concrete reasons why this was.

Well, hopefully that will change.  I am expecting **a lot** of flak to come back my way because the theory that people get angry and outraged not for sins and wrongs, but based on this one pattern.

That conclusion, is not the norm, and the theory itself is currently divergent to the views of today.

Whoo, fun times ahead !

Go to GNC.  Take Rhodiola Rosea.  It combats the negative effects of stress.  Works wonders.

> This should REALLY be a book though.

Well, it's starting to be, lol.

You have my permission to use any part of any of my explanations (or the whole thing) to go and do something with this idea.  Form your own ideas based on top of this new foundation.

But I am posting this out in the open, in part, to establish that I am the **author** of this.

Which is where the term **Author**-ity comes from.  And that's gonna be important down the road.

So yes, take this and run with it, I'll catch up with neuroscience school eventually.  I got other theories besides just divergence theory.

This matches the pattern of people's overall behavior when hostile (and it's spectrum response) closer than any other thing I know.  For the general case.  People are complex as hell.  But this is a start.

 : )

Addon:

It's important to understand that the reasons we assign to things, **why those things actually happen,** and how we feel about them are **decoupled from one another.**

That's how we are able to be so wildly off on what causes what, and how we had things like the 4 element theory of matter, or the ~~myasma~~ miasma theory of bad air for illness.

That's still going on today.

It's also why people can give reasons for why they think something is a good thing, or change out the reason for something they think is a bad thing.

It's arbitrary.

Hence, why science is so damn valuable, and also, why people keep fighting the discoveries and conclusions of science.

Now it makes sense.

Second addon:

I can also explain why evolutionary forces weeded out those without this mechanism. Basically it's a case of all humans in which they were allowed to diverge from the group, or the group itself diverged from survivable behavior, they all got wiped out. Therefore they never passed on their genes, and humans never had to evolve a mechanism to decide if they should follow some behavior, because by the necessary conclusions, unsurvivable behavior eliminated itself. And the humans that are left are the ones that will enforce ""survivable"" or normative behavior.

And how is ""survivable"" behavior enforced ?

By violence.  Anger is a **motivation to attack.**

Evolution's highly effective problem solver.

Specifically violence to others, and shame to one's self.

Don't want to eliminate your own genes, so the negative emotion.

That's why.

Third addon:

----

Before we colonized the planet, our behavior was kept in line by the forces of nature and the dangers of the natural world.

But once we colonized the planet, you're very unlikely to get eaten by a tiger on your way to work.  So the constraint on our behavior was loosened.  Sometimes, chaotically so.

Only, some behavior could develop over time that was highly problematic, yet not fatal enough to self-eliminate.  Or not quickly fatal enough to keep from spreading to the next generation and having them pick it up.

So it's high time we started to take a sobering look at how we're all behaving, including how we treat the planet and each other, and see if some of the stuff we're doing is dysfunctional as fuck.

Because that totally can happen, and does happen, as I [point out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cgk0lu/no_girls_born_for_past_three_months_in_area_of/eujzqxk/), and [again here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cgk0lu/no_girls_born_for_past_three_months_in_area_of/euk2h92/).
